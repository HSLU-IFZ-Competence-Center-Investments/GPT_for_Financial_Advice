Unveiling the Past and Present of Icelandic Volcanic Activity

In the rugged landscapes of Iceland, where the forces of nature sculpt the earth, first responders are leveraging cutting-edge technology to monitor volcanic activity. In a marriage of historical understanding and contemporary innovation, Fotokite tethered drones, equipped with thermal cameras, have become instrumental in providing real-time insights into the captivating and volatile world of Icelandic volcanoes.

Historical Context: Iceland’s Volcanic Legacy

Iceland, known as the Land of Fire and Ice, has a rich history intertwined with volcanic eruptions. From the catastrophic eruption of Mount Laki in 1783 to the more recent events like the Eyjafjallajökull eruption in 2010, the island nation has witnessed the relentless power and unpredictability of its volcanic terrain. This historical context adds depth to the significance of modern technological advancements in volcanic monitoring.

Fotokite Drones Amidst Nature’s Fury

Placed strategically near volcanic cracks in evacuated areas, Fotokite tethered drones offer a unique perspective on volcanic activity. The thermal cameras not only capture mesmerizing footage of lava flows but also provide critical data for first responders to assess the situation remotely. The all-weather IP55 rating ensures that the drones remain operational even in inclement weather, showcasing their reliability in challenging conditions. 24/7 operation provides uninterrupted video feed for continuous scene monitoring and aided decision making.

Remote Operation: Ensuring Safety and Efficiency

One of the trial features of Fotokite technology in this instance is remote operation capability. Icelandic first responders can control and monitor the drones from the safety of their control rooms, staying at a secure distance from potential hazards. This innovative approach not only enhances the efficiency of emergency response but also exemplifies the harmonious integration of technology into the realm of disaster management.

As Icelandic first responders continue to navigate the unpredictable terrains shaped by centuries of volcanic activity, the deployment of Fotokite tethered drones marks a pivotal moment in the evolution of disaster response technology. Combining historical insights into volcanic behavior with cutting-edge aerial monitoring, these drones play a crucial role in safeguarding lives and property in the face of nature’s raw power. The synergy of historical awareness and technological prowess exemplifies Iceland’s commitment to advancing emergency response strategies in an ever-changing world.

Whenever you use this website, a variety of personal information will be collected. Personal data comprises data that can be used to personally identify you. This Data Protection Declaration explains which data we collect as well as the purposes we use this data for. It also explains how, and for which purpose the information is collected.

General information on the legal basis for the data processing on this website

If you have consented to data processing, we process your personal data on the basis of Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR or Art. 9 (2)(a) GDPR, if special categories of data are processed according to Art. 9 (1) DSGVO.

If these tools are active, your personal data may potentially be transferred to these non-EU countries and may be processed there. We must point out that in these countries, a data protection level that is comparable to that in the EU cannot be guaranteed. For instance, U.S. enterprises are under a mandate to release personal data to the security agencies and you as the data subject do not have any litigation options to defend yourself in court. Hence, it cannot be ruled out that U.S. agencies (e.g., the Secret Service) may process, analyze, and permanently archive your personal data for surveillance purposes. We have no control over these processing activities.

IF YOUR PERSONAL DATA IS BEING PROCESSED IN ORDER TO ENGAGE IN DIRECT ADVERTISING, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO OBJECT TO THE PROCESSING OF YOUR AFFECTED PERSONAL DATA FOR THE PURPOSES OF SUCH ADVERTISING AT ANY TIME. THIS ALSO APPLIES TO PROFILING TO THE EXTENT THAT IT IS AFFILIATED WITH SUCH DIRECT ADVERTISING.

The right to log a complaint is in effect regardless of any other administrative or court proceedings available as legal recourses.

Right to data portability

You have the right to have data that we process automatically on the basis of your consent or in fulfillment of a contract handed over to you or to a third party in a common, machine-readable format.

If the processing of your personal data was/is conducted in an unlawful manner, you have the option to demand the restriction of the processing of your data instead of demanding the eradication of this data.
If we do not need your personal data any longer and you need it to exercise, defend or claim legal entitlements, you have the right to demand the restriction of the processing of your personal data instead of its eradication.
If you have raised an objection pursuant to Art. 21(1) GDPR, your rights and our rights will have to be weighed against each other. As long as it has not been determined whose interests prevail, you have the right to demand a restriction of the processing of your personal data.

Data transmission to the US is based on the Standard Contractual Clauses (SCC) of the European Commission. Details can be found here: https://policies.google.com/privacy/frameworks and https://privacy.google.com/businesses/controllerterms/mccs/.

Meta-Pixel (formerly Facebook Pixel)

To measure conversion rates, this website uses the visitor activity pixel of Facebook/Meta. The provider of this service is Meta Platforms Ireland Limited, 4 Grand Canal Square, Dublin 2, Ireland. According to Facebook’s statement the collected data will be transferred to the USA and other third-party countries too.

This tool allows the tracking of page visitors after they have been linked to the website of the provider after clicking on a Facebook ad. This makes it possible to analyze the effectiveness of Facebook ads for statistical and market research purposes and to optimize future advertising campaigns.

For us as the operators of this website, the collected data is anonymous. We are not in a position to arrive at any conclusions as to the identity of users. However, Facebook archives the information and processes it, so that it is possible to make a connection to the respective user profile and Facebook is in a position to use the data for its own promotional purposes in compliance with the Facebook Data Usage Policy (https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/). This enables Facebook to display ads on Facebook pages as well as in locations outside of Facebook. We as the operator of this website have no control over the use of such data.

The use of these services occurs on the basis of your consent pursuant to Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR and § 25(1) TTDSG. You may revoke your consent at any time.

Within the meta pixel, we are using the expanded alignment function.

The expanded alignment allows us to transfer to Meta (Facebook) different types of data (e.g., place of residence, federal state, zip code, hashed email addresses, names, gender, date of birth or phone number) of our customers and prospects we collect through our website. As a result of this activation, we can tailor the offers presented in our advertising campaigns on Facebook to individuals interested in what we offer even more precisely. Moreover, this expanded alignment optimizes the allocation of website conversions and expands custom audiences.

Insofar as personal data is collected on our website with the help of the tool described here and forwarded to Facebook, we and Meta Platforms Ireland Limited, 4 Grand Canal Square, Grand Canal Harbour, Dublin 2, Ireland are jointly responsible for this data processing (Art. 26 DSGVO). The joint responsibility is limited exclusively to the collection of the data and its forwarding to Facebook. The processing by Facebook that takes place after the onward transfer is not part of the joint responsibility. The obligations incumbent on us jointly have been set out in a joint processing agreement. The wording of the agreement can be found under: https://www.facebook.com/legal/controller_addendum. According to this agreement, we are responsible for providing the privacy information when using the Facebook tool and for the privacy-secure implementation of the tool on our website. Facebook is responsible for the data security of Facebook products. You can assert data subject rights (e.g., requests for information) regarding data processed by Facebook directly with Facebook. If you assert the data subject rights with us, we are obliged to forward them to Facebook.

This website uses the Insight tag from LinkedIn. This service is provided by LinkedIn Ireland Unlimited Company, Wilton Plaza, Wilton Place, Dublin 2, Ireland.

 by LinkedIn Insight tag

We use the LinkedIn Insight tag to obtain information about visitors to our website. Once a website visitor is registered with LinkedIn, we can analyze the key occupational data (e.g., career level, company size, country, location, industry, job title) of our website visitors to help us better target our site to the relevant audience. We can also use LinkedIn Insight tags to measure whether visitors to our websites make a purchase or perform other actions (conversion measurement). Conversion measurement can also be carried out across devices (e.g. from PC to tablet). LinkedIn Insight Tag also features a retargeting function that allows us to display targeted advertising to visitors to our website outside of the website. According to LinkedIn, no identification of the advertising addressee takes place.

LinkedIn itself also collects log files (URL, referrer URL, IP address, device and browser characteristics and time of access). The IP addresses are shortened or (if they are used to reach LinkedIn members across devices) hashed (pseudonymized). The direct identifiers of LinkedIn members are deleted by LinkedIn after seven days. The remaining pseudonymized data will then be deleted within 180 days.

The data collected by LinkedIn cannot be assigned by us as a website operator to specific individuals. LinkedIn will store the personal data collected from website visitors on its servers in the USA and use it for its own promotional activities. For details, please see LinkedIn’s privacy policy at https://www.linkedin.com/legal/privacy-policy#choices-oblig.

If your approval (consent) has been obtained the use of the abovementioned service shall occur on the basis of Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR and § 25 TTDSG (German Telecommunications Act). Such consent may be revoked at any time. If your consent was not obtained, the use of the service will occur on the basis of Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR; the website operator has a legitimate interest in effective advertising promotions that include the utilization of social media.

Data transmission to the US is based on the Standard Contractual Clauses (SCC) of the European Commission. Details can be found here: https://www.linkedin.com/legal/l/dpa and https://www.linkedin.com/legal/l/eu-sccs.

Objection to the use of LinkedIn Insight Tag

You can object to LinkedIn’s analysis of user behavior and targeted advertising at the following link: https://www.linkedin.com/psettings/guest-controls/retargeting-opt-out.

In addition, LinkedIn members can control the use of their personal information for promotional purposes in the account settings. To prevent LinkedIn from linking information collected on our site to your LinkedIn account, you must log out of your LinkedIn account before you visit our site.

Data processing

We have concluded a data processing agreement (DPA) for the use of the above-mentioned service. This is a contract mandated by data privacy laws that guarantees that they process personal data of our website visitors only based on our instructions and in compliance with the GDPR.

YouTube with expanded data protection integration

Our website embeds videos of the website YouTube. The website operator is Google Ireland Limited (“Google”), Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland.

We use YouTube in the expanded data protection mode. According to YouTube, this mode ensures that YouTube does not store any information about visitors to this website before they watch the video. Nevertheless, this does not necessarily mean that the sharing of data with YouTube partners can be ruled out as a result of the expanded data protection mode. For instance, regardless of whether you are watching a video, YouTube will always establish a connection with the Google DoubleClick network.

As soon as you start to play a YouTube video on this website, a connection to YouTube’s servers will be established. As a result, the YouTube server will be notified, which of our pages you have visited. If you are logged into your YouTube account while you visit our site, you enable YouTube to directly allocate your browsing patterns to your personal profile. You have the option to prevent this by logging out of your YouTube account.

Furthermore, after you have started to play a video, YouTube will be able to place various cookies on your device or comparable technologies for recognition (e.g. device fingerprinting). In this way YouTube will be able to obtain information about this website’s visitors. Among other things, this information will be used to generate video statistics with the aim of improving the user friendliness of the site and to prevent attempts to commit fraud.

Under certain circumstances, additional data processing transactions may be triggered after you have started to play a YouTube video, which are beyond our control.

The use of YouTube is based on our interest in presenting our online content in an appealing manner. Pursuant to Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR, this is a legitimate interest. If appropriate consent has been obtained, the processing is carried out exclusively on the basis of Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR and § 25 (1) TTDSG, insofar the consent includes the storage of cookies or the access to information in the user’s end device (e.g., device fingerprinting) within the meaning of the TTDSG. This consent can be revoked at any time.

Ensure team safety with increased situational awareness l Fotokite

 / Yoast SEO plugin. 

 From the first seconds of size-up to continuous monitoring for flare-ups at the end of an incident response, elevated situational awareness helps incident commanders direct resources where and when they are needed the most. The Fotokite Sigma provides access to immediate situational awareness at the push of a button without any piloting necessary throughout your mission. 

 End Page Title H1 

Save team resources and gain the elevated situational awareness that your team needs to stay safe, save lives, and preserve property. With the single push of a button, fire response teams can now quickly visualize rooftop hot spots before putting personnel on top of a building.

With non-stop flight time and secure video streaming to the ground, it is now possible to track and detect valuable intelligence in low-visibility scenarios. For example, when personnel or civilians are entering or exiting a structure throughout a response, or when visual observation is hampered by smoke or nightfall. The use of the elevated thermal camera allows you to clearly observe your scene, track your team, and direct operations. Dual video streaming quality enables the ability to clearly visualize hose lines and see if water jets are hitting where they need to, even from blocks away. Forest fire and mutual aid responses can be more efficiently understood, communicated, and coordinated in real-time given an elevated, contextual overview of your scene and the resources on site. Fotokite is an ideal daytime independent solution that allows for true emergency response to the unscheduled events.

 Fotokite. Launch and forget. 

 Having the kite be able to stay up during the duration of the incident without worrying about batteries, FAA regulations or assigning a full-time operator is invaluable.

 Cabled drone Fotokite prevents fire re-ignition protecting property at Plaza Cinema 

 In the aftermath of the fire that erupted at Plaza Cinema on August 19, Fotokite strategically deployed a cabled drone that played a pivotal role in continuous aerial surveillance, ensuring the site's safety and minimizing the risk of a renewed blaze.

 End Page Title H1 

Geneva, August 19, 2023: In the realm of firefighting, Fotokite’s revolutionary cabled drone technology has emerged as a crucial asset, showcasing its pivotal role in preventing re-ignition and contributing to the efficiency and safety of firefighting efforts in the face of complex challenges.

In the aftermath of the Plaza Cinema fire, Fotokite’s cabled drone swiftly ascended into the skies, extending its operational capabilities to continuously survey the affected area from above. This sophisticated drone was equipped with advanced real-time thermal imaging, enabling it to detect even the faintest indications of heat. The primary objective was to confine the fire to the large room, minimizing the risk of contaminating the surrounding buildings. This early detection capability proved instrumental in the proactive prevention of potential re-ignition, thereby significantly bolstering the overall firefighting strategy.

The continuous surveillance provided by the Fotokite cabled drone played a pivotal role in maintaining heightened situational awareness for the responders. This not only facilitated a more coordinated response but also elevated the safety of the response teams by mitigating the risk of unforeseen flare-ups. The ability to detect heat sources in real-time allowed the firefighting teams to take swift and informed actions, reinforcing their control over the situation.

Fotokite’s contribution extends beyond mere firefighting; it represents a paradigm shift in the way emergency responses are executed. The integration of advanced technology, such as cabled drones with real-time thermal imaging, offers a proactive approach to fire prevention, reducing the potential for escalation and ensuring the safety of both responders and the public. In essence, Fotokite’s role in this incident exemplifies how cutting-edge solutions can make a profound impact on the effectiveness and safety of firefighting operations in the modern era.

Emergency Response

 Quick and easy deployment for everyday on-scene response coordination and post-scene documentation. 

 End Page Title H1 

Fotokite is developed for emergency situations, where time is of the essence and safety is paramount. One-button deployment of Fotokite actively tethered UAV provides instant situational awareness for on-scene coordination and event documentation. This allows for a full contextual incident record build-up from the first seconds after arrival and lasting for 24+ hours if needed.

Safety and reliability is core to Fotokite technology, with built-in redundancy on propulsion, power, and flight control systems to keep your mind focused on the response at hand. Fotokite Sigma’s Rooftop configuration enables instant deployment, completely hands-free operation, and integration into vehicle power systems to remain in the air as long as the response is open. Fotokites fit well into public safety team operations at large events or accident scenes to help monitor the situation with the added intelligence that comes with persistent elevated situational awareness. For larger scale operations or mutual aid responses, optional remote video streaming allows real-time footage to be monitored from nearby command vehicles as well as streamed remotely to command centres, providing the safety-critical information needed for better real-time coordination and collaboration of the resources on-scene.

Day or night, rain or shine, pilot or not, Fotokite is ready as a safe and reliable tool to provide situational awareness on a daily basis like traditional public safety and law enforcement drones can not. With low training thresholds necessary to safely operate the Fotokite Sigma, our actively tethered UAV solution is the safest, most reliable, scalable solution for public safety teams to gain better situational awareness and full incident records in their daily operations.
