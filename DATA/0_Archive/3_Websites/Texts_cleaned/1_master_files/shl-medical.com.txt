SHL Medical, a world-leading provider of advanced drug delivery solutions, proudly announces receipt of the EcoVadis® Silver Medal for its sustainability performance, positioning the company in the top 8% globally within its industry. SHL Medical received further independent recognition for its sustainability efforts, as the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) has approved the company’s near-term emissions targets.

EcoVadis® Silver Rating validates SHL Medical’s sustainability performance

Taking bold actions towards a sustainable future – SHL Medical’s 2030 Sustainability Strategy

SHL Medical recently published its new sustainability strategy, which aims to deliver positive societal impact across three key areas: enabling patients’ independence and outcomes, reducing the ecological footprint, and ensuring responsible business practices.

“Our commitment towards sustainability is deeply ingrained in every facet of our operations”, says Ulrich Faessler, CEO of SHL Medical. “We are striving to be more transparent and accoun throughout our sustainability journey and I am proud to see independent recognition of our efforts so far, showing we are headed in the right direction. We know our responsibility extends beyond the immediate horizon, and we aim to contribute long-term value for society and the environment.”

SBTi approves SHL Medical’s climate targets

SBTi has approved SHL Medical’s ambitious science-based emissions-reduction targets for 2030. The confirmed near-term targets are:

SHL Medical commits to reducing its indirect (scope 3) greenhouse gas emissions by at least 51.6% per Mio. units sold by 2030 from a 2022 baseline year.

SHL Medical acquires Superior Tooling Inc.

Continuing its ambitious growth journey, SHL Medical has acquired Superior Tooling Inc., a US-based manufacturing company specializing in plastic injection molds. The integration of Superior Tooling will strengthen the SHL’s inhouse manufacturing capabilities, particularly for its upcoming US manufacturing site in North Charleston, SC, scheduled to begin operations in mid-2024. 

SHL Medical (hereinafter referred to as “SHL”), a world-leading provider of advanced drug delivery solutions headquartered in Switzerland, proudly announces the acquisition of Superior Tooling Inc., a US manufacturer of plastic injection molds through quality tooling, based in Wake Forest, North Carolina.

This expansion of strengths underlines SHL’s global strategy, emphasizing one of its distinctive features – full in-house manufacturing – and positions tooling as one of SHL’s core competencies close to the new manufacturing site in South Carolina.

Ulrich Faessler, Chairman and CEO of SHL Medical, looks forward to the collaboration: “The demand for our autoinjectors, including treatment areas such as diabetes and weight management, is growing rapidly. Through continuous advancements and dedication, we deliver on our strategic vision to uphold our position as market leaders. This acquisition marks a significant milestone in our journey towards globalizing our operations to better serve our customer base. We are happy to welcome Superior Tooling into the SHL family.”

Expanding tooling capabilities globally

The acquisition of Superior Tooling not only supports the tooling needs of SHL’s in-house manufacturing but also its strategy to deliver the highest quality tools to customers across industries. The US company will work closely with SHL’s existing tooling departments to develop new solutions for its global customer base.

“This marks a significant step forward for our potential and growth trajectory. We take great pride in having our capabilities recognized by a global player, and eagerly look forward to maximizing them as integral members of SHL Medical. I am confident that the synergies between our capabilities and SHL’s established tooling expertise will prove highly advantageous for both our existing and new customers,” expresses Robbie Earnhardt, President of Superior Tooling.

SHL 在醫療裝置產業累積了超過 20 年的經驗，現今更成為客群龐大的全球組織。我們與全球頂尖的生技和製藥公司合作，研發出先進拋棄式及可重複使用的藥物輸送器材 (包括固定劑量或彈性劑量)，劑量準確度高，同時也能充分滿足高劑量及高黏稠度藥劑的需求。

SHL 的創新設計及先進製程，為自動注射器的實用性奠定了業界標準。不論是客製化專案，還是現成規格裝置，我們都能與生物製藥公司密切合作研發產品，確保各種創新、提升生活品質的先進藥物都能安全有效地提供予患者。

Quick to Market™ (加速上市) 服務：全面整合能力優化開發 

2017 年，一家全球領導的醫療保健公司根據第二代 Molly 平台開啟一項專案，用以滿足客戶對自己的平台自動注射器的需求，打造獨特品牌、大量生產，同時加速不同複合式產品專案的開發。瑞健利用其端到端開發能力以及支持臨床及商業應用的全面整合服務克服挑戰。模組化形式的平台開發模式使我們能憑藉現有技術、已建立好的文件程序以及生產基礎架構推動加速開發。第一款複合式產品取得核准後，僅短短一年的時間，其同款具有相同工學設計卻搭配不同顏色組合的自動注射器，以第二款複合式產品之姿亦於美國及歐洲獲得核准。

這兩項複合式產品專案皆透過瑞健一系列具備整合性能力及服務特性的 Quick to Market™ (加速上市) 服務，成功縮短上市的前置時間。藉由精簡的流程，第二項複合式產品專案的每項重要進展都在大約一年內達成。此專案也在一個月內從取得美國食品藥物管理局核准，進展到第一次商業應用。同一年，自動注射器也通過《歐盟醫療器材法規》公告單位資格審定，並取得正面結果。

Molly® 及 Molly® 2.25：瑞健醫療模組化平台自動注射器 

隨著自動注射器領域推出的平台產品越來越多，瑞健致力於重新定義平台裝置技術並顛覆市場。除此之外，瑞健持續完善平台產品的優勢，同時在裝置的設計、開發、生產方面增加彈性 – 最終誕生了 Molly 模組化平台。

第二代 Molly 通過瑞健的主要製藥夥伴的考驗，為該客戶兩項生物製劑進行客製化設計，一項是異位性疾病的大分子藥物，另一項是高脂血症的治療。裝置必須配合客戶的工學設計及品牌偏好，並依據生物製劑的主要藥劑瓶進行調整。奠定於前一代的成功基礎，Molly 模組化平台技術能夠滿足客戶專案的規格要求，最終完成一系列不同工學設計特性的客製化裝置，並與主要藥劑瓶相容。值得注意的是，全球第一個高劑量範圍 (≥2.0 mL) 自動注射器之一的開發及商業化，即是採用 Molly 2.25 平台順利完成。

第二代 Molly 為瑞健的製藥夥伴提供彈性的解決方案，透過模組化擴充，持續提升 Molly 生態系統的價值，帶動全球各地夥伴的商業成功。

Molly 自動注射器平台的成立，標幟著瑞健致力進一步滿足客戶及其患者的多樣化需求。2010 年推出的 Molly，是瑞健第一款主打規格化設計的自動注射器，幫助製藥公司減少初期投資成本，並加快開發時程。

Molly 只需要兩個簡單的步驟：1. 開蓋，2. 注射，即完成全部流程。以平台打造 Molly 自動注射器透過瑞健的整合性服務，從加工、組裝、測試到終端組裝，協助提高開發流程的效率。Molly 推出僅一年，即榮獲 2011 年優良設計獎，凸顯其引領社會潮流的優異設計。

Molly 平台基礎架構的共通性，有助於同時展開各項需求重疊的裝置專案，僅僅在 2016 年，此規格化的裝置就以至少 3 項複合式產品的形式上市，涵蓋發炎、自體免疫疾病及偏頭痛等適應症。另一方面，Molly 垂直整合開發模組還滿足偏頭痛產品的最終組裝、貼標和包裝需求。瑞健的 Quick to Market™ (加速上市) 服務也促使客戶的偏頭痛產品專案在短短九個月內，即完成裝置開發到臨床應用。

SHL 拋棄式自動注射器 DAI 於 2006 年上市，屬全球最早期的現代化自動注射器之一。

第一款 DAI 是由美國一間跨國生物製藥公司委託製造，是一款以按鈕擊發、僅需三步驟即可完成注射、且預充填劑量為 1mL的拋棄式注射器。客戶期望能取代傳統的針筒裝注射劑或小藥瓶，使患者自行施打皮下注射的過程更簡便順利。因此，DAI 強調符合人體工學的設計，在注射開始和結束時皆可聽到咔嗒聲，而其自動輸送機制可在幾秒鐘內完成注射。屬近代最早期的現代化自動注射器之一，DAI 更進一步協助奠定全球生物製劑自我注射療法的標準。

隨著 DAI 上市，瑞健也成為全球自動注射器市場的知名領導企業，DAI 的創新設計更榮獲 2006 年台灣精品獎。雖然至今現代化自動注射器的設計已有長足進展，DAI 仍是最受歡迎的自動注射器之一。

Quick to Market™ services: fully integrated competencies for optimized development 

The Molly® modular platform technology offers not just flexibility in design and manufacturing, but also optimization in product development.

In 2017, a leading global healthcare company kicked off a project based on the second-generation Molly platform – chosen to fulfill the customer’s need for its own platform autoinjector for unique branding, high-volume production, as well as faster development across different combination product projects. SHL rose to the challenge with end-to-end development capabilities and fully integrated services supporting clinical and commercial delivery. The modular approach to platform development allowed us to leverage existing methodologies, documentation, as well as production infrastructures to support faster development. In just a year after the combination product received its first approval, the autoinjector – featuring the same industrial design with different color combinations – was approved as a second combination product in the US and in Europe.

Both these combination product projects were supported by SHL’s Quick to Market™ services – a program featuring a range of in-house competencies and services in support of speeding up marketing lead time. As a result of the streamlined processes, every important milestone of the second combination product project was achieved within around a year of each other. The project also advanced from US FDA approval to its first commercial delivery in under a month. That same year, the autoinjector also went through the EU Medical Device Regulation Notified Body opinion with a positive outcome.

Molly® and Molly® 2.25: SHL Medical’s modular platform autoinjector 

With more platform products emerging in the autoinjector space, SHL sought to redefine how platform device technologies can disrupt the market. Further refined to offer the advantages of platform products while offering flexibility in the device’s design, development, and production – the Molly modular platform was born.

This new generation of Molly was put to test with a leading pharma partner of SHL needing a customizable device offering for two of its biologics – a molecule for atopic disorders and another for hyperlipidemia. The device had to address the customer’s industrial design and branding preferences, as well as the primary container of the biologics in question. Building upon the successes of its predecessor, the Molly modular platform technology was able to fulfill the projects’ specifications, resulting in customized device families featuring distinct industrial designs that are conformant to the primary container. Of important note, the Molly 2.25 variant supported the development and commercialization of the world’s first autoinjector in the higher volume range (≥2.0 mL).

This evolution of Molly as a flexible solution to SHL’s pharmaceutical partners will continue with modular expansions that add value to Molly’s ecosystem and increasing commercial successes around the world.

PPI®: High-precision autoinjector for extremely viscous formulations 

The development of the Precision Pen Injector (PPI) is a story of uncompromising dedication to meeting industry challenges.

A Swedish company specializing in solutions for aesthetics and corrective treatment sought to introduce an autoinjector for its skin booster – a highly viscous hyaluronic acid formulation of several hundred centipoise. The company needed a device that could deliver small and very precise doses of this treatment while addressing the challenges the filler market did not have at the time, such as drooling and overdosing.

To meet these challenges, our design engineers created the Rotaject®, a patented clock spring technology that made it possible for a mechanically driven injector to deliver small (10 μL) and consistent dosages of highly viscous formulations for up to 200 times from a 2.25 mL pre-filled syringe. Working with various study groups, we developed a -friendly device that maintained a balance between its shape and weight versus its mechanical properties. The result was the PPI – a sleek and aesthetically pleasing pen injector that went on to win the prestigious Red Dot Design Award for product design in 2009.

DAI®: Button activated autoinjector 

2006 marked the commercial launch of one of the world’s first modern autoinjectors – SHL’s Disposable Autoinjector, more commonly known as DAI.

The first DAI was built for a multinational biopharmaceutical company headquartered in the US. It is a button-activated, 3-step disposable device for 1 mL pre-filled syringes. We were tasked to design an injection device that could facilitate an easier subcutaneous self-injection experience compared to the alternative pre-filled syringe or vial. For this reason, DAI features an ergonomic interface with two audible clicks at the beginning and end of injection, as well as an automatic delivery mechanism that successfully delivers the drug in a matter of seconds. As one of the first modern autoinjectors, DAI helped set the standard for biological self-injection treatments worldwide. 

The commercial launch of DAI put SHL on the map as a recognized leader in the global autoinjector market. DAI later went on to win the 2006 Taiwan Excellence Award for its innovative design features. And while the design of modern autoinjectors has since evolved, DAI remains to be one of the most popular and sought-after autoinjectors today.

PenInject 2.25: SHL’s 1st injector project 

SHL’s dedication to designing patient-centric products is evident in our very first injector, the PenInject 2.25.

Our journey into the autoinjector industry began in the mid-1990s when a Swedish pharmaceutical company tasked us to design and manufacture an easy-to-use injection device to work with its lyophilized drug. The treatment was already approved in the vial and prefilled syringe format for 2.25 mL dosing, and the injector needed to complement the original packaging to enhance the user experience.

SHL’s PenInject 2.25 was among the industry’s first to have successfully transformed a syringe-based drug product into an easy-to-use autoinjector. As a reusable, button-activated device, it offered a more intuitive alternative to the original self-injection method, including a mechanism that kept the needle hidden during the injection process. Importantly, PenInject 2.25 was given a sleek, elegant, and discreet pen-like design, affording patients an extra sense of privacy associated with their treatment. As SHL’s first injection project, PenInject 2.25 continues to represent SHL’s dedication to designing products that are centered around the patient.

 announces plans for a new manufacturing site in the US
’s new manufacturing site in South Carolina, US

SHL Medical (hereinafter referred to as “SHL”) has revealed plans for a new manufacturing site in the US, in response to the growing market demand for its autoinjector product portfolio. The decision stems from SHL’s strategic assessments in extending its production to North America.

The new US site will be located in North Charleston, South Carolina, and will boast approximately 25,000 m2 (270,000 ft2). With initial investments of US$ 90 million, SHL is expected to create an estimate of 165 local employment opportunities. Operations are expected to launch by 2024. 

The South Carolina site will be an advanced facility with medical device injection molding and fully automated assembly capabilities. Together with SHL’s current final assembly, labeling, and packaging operations in Deerfield Beach, Florida, the expanded manufacturing capabilities in the US will further fortify SHL’s offerings in delivering comprehensive services to its partners.

In 2019, SHL developed a long-term strategy in response to the growing autoinjector demand and to meet future manufacturing needs. The announcement of the new US operation aligns with the company’s ongoing expansion, including a new Swiss site already being announced. The new production site in the US, which is to be realized preferentially and accelerated, will offer fully automated production facilities and a flexible supply chain with reduced distance to main markets.

Chairman and CEO Ulrich Faessler comments: “Demand for SHL’s products has increased significantly. Therefore, we are speeding up our plans for a new plant in the US. Similar to our upcoming European site in Zug, Switzerland, the US site will be a state-of-the-art, fully automated site. This expansion signifies SHL’s pledge to our advanced manufacturing strategy that will support our sustainability goals; and, at the same time, risk-mitigate supply chain disturbances through closer production with our customers, in light of various global events from the past two years. This further supports our customers with one-stop-shop capabilities, providing high-quality drug delivery systems to the end-s – the patients.”

As a world-leading solutions provider of advanced drug delivery systems, SHL Medical is the partner of choice for many leading pharma and biotech companies.

Quick to Market™ services: fully integrated competencies for optimized development 

The Molly® modular platform technology offers not just flexibility in design and manufacturing, but also optimization in product development.

In 2017, a leading global healthcare company kicked off a project based on the second-generation Molly platform – chosen to fulfill the customer’s need for its own platform autoinjector for unique branding, high-volume production, as well as faster development across different combination product projects. SHL rose to the challenge with end-to-end development capabilities and fully integrated services supporting clinical and commercial delivery. The modular approach to platform development allowed us to leverage existing methodologies, documentation, as well as production infrastructures to support faster development. In just a year after the combination product received its first approval, the autoinjector – featuring the same industrial design with different color combinations – was approved as a second combination product in the US and in Europe.

Both these combination product projects were supported by SHL’s Quick to Market™ services – a program featuring a range of in-house competencies and services in support of speeding up marketing lead time. As a result of the streamlined processes, every important milestone of the second combination product project was achieved within around a year of each other. The project also advanced from US FDA approval to its first commercial delivery in under a month. That same year, the autoinjector also went through the EU Medical Device Regulation Notified Body opinion with a positive outcome.

Molly® and Molly® 2.25: SHL Medical’s modular platform autoinjector 

With more platform products emerging in the autoinjector space, SHL sought to redefine how platform device technologies can disrupt the market. Further refined to offer the advantages of platform products while offering flexibility in the device’s design, development, and production – the Molly modular platform was born.

This new generation of Molly was put to test with a leading pharma partner of SHL needing a customizable device offering for two of its biologics – a molecule for atopic disorders and another for hyperlipidemia. The device had to address the customer’s industrial design and branding preferences, as well as the primary container of the biologics in question. Building upon the successes of its predecessor, the Molly modular platform technology was able to fulfill the projects’ specifications, resulting in customized device families featuring distinct industrial designs that are conformant to the primary container. Of important note, the Molly 2.25 variant supported the development and commercialization of the world’s first autoinjector in the higher volume range (≥2.0 mL).

This evolution of Molly as a flexible solution to SHL’s pharmaceutical partners will continue with modular expansions that add value to Molly’s ecosystem and increasing commercial successes around the world.

Molly®: SHL Medical’s first preconfigured autoinjector 

The establishment of the Molly platform signifies SHL’s commitment to further addressing the varying needs of our customers and their patients. Introduced in 2010, Molly is SHL’s first preconfigured autoinjector designed to help pharmaceutical companies reduce initial investments and expedite development timelines.

Molly features just two simple steps: uncap and inject. As a platform device technology, Molly is supported by SHL’s in-house tooling, assembly, testing, and final assembly infrastructure that is designed to support a fully streamlined product development. Just a year after its launch, Molly went on to win the 2011 Good Design Award, signifying its embodiment of a society-leading good design.

The commonality of Molly’s platform infrastructures has allowed SHL to undertake various overlapping device projects. In 2016 alone, this preconfigured offering has enabled the commercial launch of at least three combination products indicated for inflammatory and autoimmune diseases, as well as migraine. With the Molly technology’s vertically integrated development model, SHL also fulfilled the final assembly, labeling, and packaging requirements of the migraine device. These Quick to Market™ services led the migraine device project to advance from device development to clinical delivery in less than nine months.

PPI®: High-precision autoinjector for extremely viscous formulations 

The development of the Precision Pen Injector (PPI) is a story of uncompromising dedication to meeting industry challenges.

A Swedish company specializing in solutions for aesthetics and corrective treatment sought to introduce an autoinjector for its skin booster – a highly viscous hyaluronic acid formulation of several hundred centipoise. The company needed a device that could deliver small and very precise doses of this treatment while addressing the challenges the filler market did not have at the time, such as drooling and overdosing.

To meet these challenges, our design engineers created the Rotaject®, a patented clock spring technology that made it possible for a mechanically driven injector to deliver small (10 μL) and consistent dosages of highly viscous formulations for up to 200 times from a 2.25 mL pre-filled syringe. Working with various study groups, we developed a -friendly device that maintained a balance between its shape and weight versus its mechanical properties. The result was the PPI – a sleek and aesthetically pleasing pen injector that went on to win the prestigious Red Dot Design Award for product design in 2009.

DAI®: Button activated autoinjector 

2006 marked the commercial launch of one of the world’s first modern autoinjectors – SHL’s Disposable Autoinjector, more commonly known as DAI.

The first DAI was built for a multinational biopharmaceutical company headquartered in the US. It is a button-activated, 3-step disposable device for 1 mL pre-filled syringes. We were tasked to design an injection device that could facilitate an easier subcutaneous self-injection experience compared to the alternative pre-filled syringe or vial. For this reason, DAI features an ergonomic interface with two audible clicks at the beginning and end of injection, as well as an automatic delivery mechanism that successfully delivers the drug in a matter of seconds. As one of the first modern autoinjectors, DAI helped set the standard for biological self-injection treatments worldwide. 

The commercial launch of DAI put SHL on the map as a recognized leader in the global autoinjector market. DAI later went on to win the 2006 Taiwan Excellence Award for its innovative design features. And while the design of modern autoinjectors has since evolved, DAI remains to be one of the most popular and sought-after autoinjectors today.

As one of the first modern autoinjectors, DAI helped set the standard for biological self-injection treatments worldwide.

The commercial launch of DAI put SHL on the map as a recognized leader in the global autoinjector market. DAI later went on to win the 2006 Taiwan Excellence Award for its innovative design features. And while the design of modern autoinjectors has since evolved, DAI remains to be one of the most popular and sought-after autoinjectors today.

PenInject 2.25: SHL’s 1st injector project 

SHL’s dedication to designing patient-centric products is evident in our very first injector, the PenInject 2.25.

Our journey into the autoinjector industry began in the mid-1990s when a Swedish pharmaceutical company tasked us to design and manufacture an easy-to-use injection device to work with its lyophilized drug. The treatment was already approved in the vial and prefilled syringe format for 2.25 mL dosing, and the injector needed to complement the original packaging to enhance the user experience.

SHL’s PenInject 2.25 was among the industry’s first to have successfully transformed a syringe-based drug product into an easy-to-use autoinjector. As a reusable, button-activated device, it offered a more intuitive alternative to the original self-injection method, including a mechanism that kept the needle hidden during the injection process. Importantly, PenInject 2.25 was given a sleek, elegant, and discreet pen-like design, affording patients an extra sense of privacy associated with their treatment. As SHL’s first injection project, PenInject 2.25 continues to represent SHL’s dedication to designing products that are centered around the patient.
