How Wärtsilä Revolutionizes Maritime Training with Varjo XR Technology

Wärtsilä is developing innovative mixed reality training solutions that hold potential to revolutionize the way seafarers are trained.

Wärtsilä has been in the marine simulation business for more than 30 years. Headquartered in Finland and employing more than 17,000 people, the company is the global leader in the commercial marine training space and is also growing rapidly in the naval segment. 

Wärtsilä currently has more than 3,000 simulator installations worldwide for many use cases such as navigation, cargo handling, engine rooms, and more. These simulators range from full mission bridge simulators to standalone trainers and desktop simulators, all of which aim to replicate ship operations to varying degrees of complexity.

While traditional simulators have been extremely useful in maritime training, the company is now enhancing existing training capabilities with new mixed reality training solutions that will revolutionize the way seafarers are trained.

Challenge: How to make high-quality training more accessible 

All seafarers undertake regular training both for professional development and regulatory purposes. Traditional simulators are an effective way of meeting these training needs, but they have challenges when it comes to scalability and training velocity.

Maritime simulators typically feature physical controls and multiple 2D screens to project the scenario for the user. These multi-screen setups have significant building and operating costs. For example, a full mission bridge simulator’s visual infrastructure alone can consist of dozens of high-end projectors and computers. The physical size and complexity of the simulators also means installing simulators is slow, taking weeks at minimum.

Large simulators also require large facilities and active maintenance, which aren’t available everywhere. There is a limited number of maritime training centers available worldwide, which limits the available training hours and throughput.

Previous immersive solutions lacked sufficient quality

Wärtsilä has long sought and pioneered innovative technologies to enhance its offering for customers and make training more accessible. But until now, the VR/XR technologies available have not simply been good enough to complement traditional training solutions.

The problem with virtual reality has been that the visual quality has been lacking, and VR hasn’t been effective enough to meet the demands of maritime training. This is because most VR headsets block out the real world, preventing training with real-world controllers and instruments, developing muscle memory, and offering very limited collaboration with other trainees.

Solution: Best-in-class mixed reality training systems

Wärtsilä has explored various mixed reality technologies as a potential solution to scaling the availability of training and providing a more cost-effective solution for its customers. During this journey, Wärtsilä came across Varjo.

According to , Head of Product Simulation & Training, Wärtsilä, the company had tried other VR and XR technology providers before, but none of them had the required visual quality – until Varjo came along.

“No other device beyond Varjo’s Focal Edition had the required visual quality or ability to reach the level of immersion we needed,” Ekvall says.

“Varjo was the first technology provider able to meet our requirements. ”

 Head of Products, Wärtsilä Voyage

True multi-user training with mixed reality

Another breakthrough was that Wärtsilä could finally unlock true multi-user training for HMD-based solutions, thanks to Varjo’s advanced video pass-through XR capabilities. Many maritime training scenarios must incorporate several people as seafarers operate together in the real world. A good example is bridge resource management training, where several people need to be in the same physical space and communicate together in real-time.

With Varjo’s mixed reality, multi-user training becomes much easier as the trainees can see and talk to each other naturally while operating in a virtual environment. Using XR headsets also provides full 360-degree observational angles, as the size of physical 2D screens no longer limits the virtual scenario.

Thanks to Varjo’s mixed reality, Wärtsilä is now exploring many kinds of advanced simulators to train future seafarers. One of the practical customer implementations Wärtsilä has developed so far is the Marine Small Boat Trainer. Wärtsilä has developed the trainer with their own proprietary 3D engine using Varjo’s native SDK. The solution uniquely leverages multiple key technologies only available in Varjo headsets – including real-time chroma keying, masking, and Varjo Lab Tools – probably making it one of the most technologically advanced XR training setups in the world.

Practical application of XR: Marine Small Boat Trainer

In this simulator, two trainees sit together in a small vessel cockpit and wear Focal Edition headsets.

 One person drives the vessel while the co-pilot focuses on navigation, communication, observation, and other tasks. The simulator seamlessly blends real and digital objects to provide a highly immersive training solution.

The simulator features a physical cockpit with real controls and equipment like radios, screens, and navigational charts. A virtual environment is projected outside of the cockpit, and even parts of the cockpit itself, like the roof and back wall, are also virtual. This seamless blending of digital and real worlds is possible thanks to Varjo’s chroma keying and masking capabilities, ensuring a full sense of immersion.

In addition, the entire simulator is placed on a motion platform, which provides a realistic sense of motion that you’d experience out on the seas. This is a game changer for small boat trainers because a light craft moves around a lot out on the sea.

“Accurately replicating the sense of physical movement increases immersion and effectiveness of training outcomes by a large degree. No other solution has achieved this level of immersion in the past,” says Nikita Kadrov, Chief Product Owner, Simulation & Training, Wärtsilä.

In this kind of training scenario, visual clarity is crucial. There are a lot of instruments, screens, and charts, and trainees need to be able to read them accurately, even in a moving environment. With Varjo Focal Edition’s high visual clarity up close, trainees can naturally interact with these instruments and objects like they would in the real world.

These combined technologies result in the simulator providing a degree of immersion like no other solution in the maritime space.

XR brings major benefits 

Although it is still early days for XR deployments, Wärtsilä sees that mixed reality simulators have multiple clear benefits for scaling maritime training, by complementing the traditional simulators. The first advantage is reduced cost and better return on investment. “Varjo’s mixed reality can reduce the visual infrastructure cost alone by 40–80% compared to traditional maritime simulators. This is because you need a lot less hardware and the simulator is much faster to set up,” says Johan Ekvall.

Compared to traditional screen-based simulators that take weeks to install and require large facilities and dozens of computers, mixed reality simulators only require a single GPU-powered computer per headset and take, at most, a couple of days to set up.

Fewer computers and screens also mean less need for physical space and much lower maintenance costs. Most importantly, XR simulators allow efficient scaling of training as adding additional simulators no longer requires much additional space. This can lead to increased training volumes and throughput, resulting in a lower cost per trainee. All these factors combined can mean better margins, more revenue, and wider access to training, resulting in almost immediate positive returns on investment.

“In the future, mixed reality is going to be one of the cornerstone technologies of maritime training.”

Johan Ekvall

 Head of Products, Wärtsilä Voyage

The world needs more and more competent seafarers. Advanced training solutions and courses have traditionally been fairly expensive and available to a minimal subset of trainees.

“As the cost and volume of training can be reduced with XR solutions, training can be made available in more places far more efficiently and at an affordable price,” Ekvall says. This democratization of training will eventually lead to more skilled seafarers, which the entire marine industry can benefit from.

With early positive feedback from customers and partners, Johan Ekvall and his team are curious to see where mixed reality can take Wärtsilä and the entire maritime training industry in the future.

“In the future, mixed reality is going to be one of the cornerstone technologies of maritime training. The business case and early results from adopting them are simply undeniable.”

Degrees of freedom in VR or XR

Degrees of freedom (DoF) refer to the number of ways an object can move through 3D space. There are six total degrees of freedom.

Three correspond to rotational movement around the x, y, and z axes. These are commonly known as pitch, yaw, and roll.
The other three correspond to translational movement along those axes. This can be thought of as moving forward or backward, moving left or right, and moving up or down.

Virtual and mixed reality headsets typically offer experiences in either three (3-DoF) or six degrees of freedom (6-DoF). Degrees of freedom are an essential concept in VR and XR that allows human movement to be converted into movement within the VR environment.

3-DoF means being able to track rotational motion but not translational. For headsets, this means being able to track whether the user has turned their head left or right, tilted it up or down, or pivoted left and right.
6-DoF means being able to track both rotational and translational motion. In addition to being able to track head movements, this means being able to detect whether the user has moved forward, backward, laterally, or vertically.

All Varjo headsets are 6-DoF headsets.

How to create VR/XR content

Virtual reality content is everything the user sees inside the headset, run by a 3D engine. The 3D engine draws the picture to the VR headset, and the content can be anything from a game environment to an architectural model. In mixed reality, video pass-through of the real world is combined with this fully virtual content.

There are many ways to build VR content, but one of the easiest ways to get started is using 3D engines like Unity or Unreal, as they offer a graphical interface for modeling various environments in high detail. Although building these environments can be time-consuming, once ready, they can then be easily displayed in the VR headset for the user to engage with.

VR content can also be built with a broad range of professional design software. For more complex applications, custom engines can also be developed from the ground up, but this is a lengthy and expensive process.

Additionally, one interesting method for showing realistic and life-like environments in virtual reality is to do a photogrammetry scan from a real-world location and show it as a digital twin in VR.

How Lufthansa Aviation Training Accelerates Commercial Pilot Training With XR

Lufthansa Aviation Training partnered with BRUNNER and Varjo to explore innovative mixed reality solutions to complement their traditional aircraft training.

The NovaSim MR DA42 simulator developed by BRUNNER combines the use of a realistic cockpit with the advanced mixed reality of the Varjo’s Focal Edition headset, providing trainees with an immersive and realistic training experience.

Key Benefits of Mixed Reality:

Increased frequency and volume of training
Ability to conduct training all year round, even during weather conditions that prevent using real aircraft
Substantial improvements in operating costs and environmental impact
An engaging and effective training experience trainees want to engage in

Lufthansa Aviation Training is the flight academy subsidiary of Lufthansa and a leading full-service provider of commercial pilot training with more than 60 years of experience in the business. Every year, they train more than 700 pilots across six different training centers.

While real-life aircraft, such as the Diamond DA42, are used as a key part of the training, Lufthansa Aviation Training is constantly on the lookout for new methods and technologies to make the training better and more effective. This led them to partner with BRUNNER and Varjo in order to leverage mixed reality as part of their training curriculum.

The Challenge: How to Provide Immersive, Efficient Training, 24/7

Training in a real aircraft is still the best method of training commercial pilots, but it has several limitations. As the number of aircraft and instructors is limited, heavily relying on training in physical aircraft would mean the volume of pilots you are able to train and the frequency of instruction you can provide them with is relatively low.

When working with pilot trainees, you also can’t fly training flights in all weather conditions such as during low visibility. These kinds of conditions can last for a long time, and can slow down training considerably, so having alternative training methods available during these periods is extremely useful.

Furthermore, training in a real aircraft carries substantial costs and there are environmental factors to take into account as well, so other cost-effective methods to increase the training frequency can be very beneficial. For example, an hour spent in a simulator is considerably cheaper than an hour in an aircraft, and the velocity and frequency of training can be improved significantly. 

The Solution: A State-of-the-art Mixed Reality Flight Simulator

While nothing can fully replace training in a real aircraft, new technologies that can complement this training are extremely useful. This led to Lufthansa exploring innovative mixed reality simulator solutions with BRUNNER and Varjo.

BRUNNER’s NovaSim MR DA42 simulator features a real cockpit and utilizes mixed reality provided by the Varjo Focal Edition headset. This provides several advantages over traditional physical simulators. With the high-quality video pass-through, the trainee can see their hands and body, and operate all switches, controls and instrument panels with perfect clarity.

The virtual scenario is projected outside the cockpit and provides the trainee with a 360-degree view, allowing them to naturally look anywhere in the virtual environment – unlike in a traditional simulator which is often limited to around 180 degrees.

“The new generation of pilots will be able to reach their targets quicker, become more professional, and do it at a lower cost, in a more environmentally friendly way.”

 -
 Team Leader for Synthetic Training at Lufthansa Aviation Training

Furthermore, using accessories like kneeboards is extremely easy, and the extremely high resolution of the Focal Edition allows you to easily read even small text with perfect clarity. The mixed reality camera system in the Varjo headset is calibrated to provide improved image clarity in the 30 cm to 80 cm range (12” to 31”) from the headset, in comparison to a standard XR-3, which means it provides an even better experience for flight training scenarios.

All of this allows Lufthansa Aviation Training to provide instruction to pilots of tomorrow in new formats the trainees are eager to engage in, while improving the training volumes and reducing costs and environmental effects.

Daniel Jäger, Team Leader for Synthetic Training at Lufthansa Aviation Training pilot school in Switzerland, says the simulator experience was far better than they initially expected.

He sees many benefits with the mixed reality simulator, which they will introduce into the training program in the future. The system is now ongoing an official certification process. “We can clearly see the future in mixed reality. We can use it in training with the young generation, and they’ll be able to reach their targets quicker, become more professional, and do it at a lower cost, in a more environmentally friendly way.”

How Lucid Reality Labs and Roche Raise Awareness for Macular Disease with Varjo Mixed Reality

Macular disease is a common eye disorder affecting millions of people around the world, but there is a significant lack of public awareness and research funding on the disease.

To tackle this issue, Lucid Reality Labs and Roche built a mixed reality experience that allows users to see first-hand how the medical condition affects the patients’ vision.

Macular Disease impacts millions but lacks public awareness

Macular disease, or macular degeneration, is a medical condition affecting around 1.5 million people of all ages in the UK alone. It results in blurred or no vision in the center of the visual field. Early on there are often no symptoms but over time patients experience a gradual worsening of vision that may affect one or both eyes. While it does not result in complete blindness, loss of central vision can make it hard to recognize faces, drive, read, or perform other activities of daily life.

While preventative measures such as treatments, exercising and eating well can be taken, there is currently no cure or treatment that returns vision that has already been lost. Unfortunately, as the phenomenon is poorly understood and can’t be observed with the naked eye, timely diagnostics and treatment may slow down the disease and diminish the severity of vision loss.

How mixed reality enables increased awareness of the disease

 Footage captured through the Varjo headset showcases how macular disease impacts the patient's vision

This lack of awareness and research funding led Roche to search for ways to attract more attention to the cause. They were looking for an innovative way to communicate the cause and turned to Lucid Reality Labs in order to build a mixed reality experience where people can experience how macular disease affects one’s vision. 

The goal of the project was to bring attention to and raise awareness of macular disease, especially among decision-makers, to facilitate National Health Service (NHS) funding aimed at macular disease early stage prevention, awareness and treatment.

The XR experience uses a headset, allowing the user to first see the real world in perfect visual clarity. An overlay is then created on top of the real world that simulates macular disease symptoms, partially blocking the person’s visual field. This allows the person wearing the headset to safely experience first-hand what everyday life with the disease would be like, enabling them to understand how even the simplest tasks can become a challenge if suffering from this condition.

XR enables many research and medical use cases

XR experience developed by Lucid Reality Labs with Roche perfectly demonstrates that mixed reality is extremely well suited to different kinds of research and medical use cases. 

By enabling the seamless blending of real and digital worlds, mixed reality also allows changing and observing the reality the user sees. This allows, for example, the simulation of medical conditions affecting a person’s vision in complete safety. It can also have other applications such as phobia research or behavioral studies.

Mixed reality solutions providing cost savings and practicality in research

With Varjo’s mixed reality solutions, research professionals can easily create any true-to-life environment for advanced clinical, academic, or commercial studies. They allow recreating the exact feeling and conditions of real-world studies, which enables researchers to gain meaningful behavioral insights – without the impracticalities and high costs of real-world studies.

Varjo headsets also feature high-accuracy eye tracking, and data from it can be combined with biometric data from another platform to measure human behavior and cognitive load to give researchers insights into human behavior that have not been possible before. 

XR research is rapidly starting to gather momentum, with numerous studies being published every year. While we are still in the early stages of research using virtual and mixed reality, we will see an increasing rate of adoption in the future as the technology has now advanced to a point where real-world applications can be achieved in a meaningful way. 

If you are interested in learning more about how Varjo headsets could be used in your next research project, get in touch with our experts or read more about the use of VR/XR for research.

What kind of content can I view in VR? Can I view video content?

Typically, any kind of 3D assets can be viewed in virtual reality (VR), such as 3D CAD models, 3D scanned environments (including photogrammetry scans) or even 360° videos. The 3D assets need to be compiled in game engines such as Unity and Unreal Engine to be viewable in VR. 360-degree videos can be viewed in VR with specific applications such as the Steam 360 video player.

If you would like to use your standard 2D computer applications such as Microsoft Word, Outlook, Visual studio code, or even view your pictures, YouTube videos, or other 2D content on your VR headset, this can also be accomplished. All Varjo headsets are equipped with a virtual desktop feature called  Varjo Workspace. The feature can be enabled and disabled via the Varjo Base software, and you can reposition and resize the virtual desktop to your preference. The virtual desktop allows you to bring in any Windows application to VR or XR, bridging the 2D and 3D worlds together.

Kia Launches New EV9 Model in Finland with Varjo's Mixed Reality

The automotive giant sets precedent for an entirely new way of launching car models with mixed reality, effectively bridging the gap between a car model’s announcement and its physical availability.

Ahead-of-the-Curve Approach to Car Launches

The new Kia EV9 is positioned as the most luxurious model ever built by Kia.

EV9 stands out as a fully electric vehicle that is over five meters long, boasts a 100-kilowatt battery, fast-charging capabilities, a towing capacity of 2,500 kilograms, and seating for seven – a unique combination in the market set to challenge other premium luxury, fully electric SUVs currently available.

In an event held on October 4-5, 2023, Kia made waves by launching its new car model, Kia EV9, to Finnish press, stakeholders, and dealer network with a pioneering mixed reality showcase. 

Although the first models of the EV9 have yet to set tires on Finnish soil, the mixed reality experience provided by Varjo offered launch event attendees a first-of-its-kind sneak peek of the unreleased vehicle, allowing them to experience the model virtually in a highly immersive environment before its official physical launch.

“The slogan of the Kia EV9 is ‘Here to Reshape the Way We Move’. This aligns seamlessly with the ideology of this launch event, as we are in the process of changing how we represent new cars and are bringing entirely new elements into the launch process,” says Mikko Autio, Kia PR Manager at Astara Finland.

At the EV9 launch event held in Vantaa, Finland, the venue was equipped with a Varjo headset and a car seat strategically placed at the center of the space. Visitors were invited to wear the headset and take the driver’s seat, immersing themselves in a mixed reality experience showing the virtual EV9 in its full scale in the middle of the real-world physical space.

The virtual car model, built with Unreal Engine, accurately depicts both the EV9’s exterior and interior down to the smallest detail. Attendees got the opportunity to explore the vehicle’s various features and details, even the smallest buttons and instruments within the cockpit, providing a unique level of insight into what the new model has to offer.

In the past, Kia’s car launches in Finland were much more limited in scale when the physical car model was not yet available, consisting of a press conference often supplemented by a few images and a video presentation. For many local dealers and partners, laying eyes on the new model requires a waiting game of sometimes several months until the car’s arrival in the country. Given the delivery time – and considering that the Kia EV9 is a brand-new model that many are eagerly anticipating – it’s highly beneficial for Kia to be able to showcase the car early to Finnish stakeholders who are keen to experience it.

“Launching a car with mixed reality is a pioneering approach bringing something entirely new to the table. We are industry-first in using this technique, leading the way not just in Finland but also on a global scale,” says , Kia Brand Director at Astara Finland.

The collaboration between Kia in Finland and Varjo began to take shape the year preceding the launch event, tracing back to Autio’s first visit to Varjo’s headquarters in Helsinki. During the visit, the Autio noticed models from different brands being showcased through advanced virtual and mixed reality, sparking curiosity and ideas for future collaboration. “While visiting Varjo, we got into a discussion and thought, ‘Why not just start a project like this together here in Finland?’ We had all the tools to do so, and that chat was the spark that kicked off our collaboration,” Autio recalls.

Since that pivotal conversation, a continuous dialogue between Kia’s Finland organization and Kia Europe has driven collaboration that eventually led to the creation and permits for the virtual model showcased at the launch event. The teams worked cohesively together to address and resolve any questions raised by Kia’s global teams on this first-time initiative, ensuring that the project not only got off the ground but also showed precedent in redefining car launch experiences for the brand.

This launch marked the first instance where mixed reality technology was used to introduce a car model not yet physically available. The approach allowed local stakeholders to engage with the vehicle in a way that is significantly different from just watching videos or viewing pictures. Users who tried it were particularly excited about VR/XR’s potential and capabilities in understanding a vehicle’s scale and details.

“You can “feel” the true size of the car in a totally different way compared to videos or pictures, which is particularly useful with larger models like the Kia EV9. Providing customers the opportunity to see the vehicle’s actual dimensions before the physical cars arrive is a big advantage,” Autio notes.

The mixed reality experience provided by Varjo stands out for its realistic output and high-resolution details. Not only do customers get a sense of the vehicle’s size, but they can also explore its interior, scrutinizing all the intricate details in human-eye resolution.

“It’s quite impressive that users can inspect features like the EV9’s unique lighting patterns up close. They can also observe the textures on the surfaces and the interior, allowing them to almost sense how these elements would feel in reality,” Autio describes.

Rave Reviews Highlight the Magic of Mixed Reality

Feedback from participants who experienced the virtual EV9 at the launch event has been overwhelmingly positive. Remarks included enthusiastic statements such as, “This experience is the closest thing to magic I’ve experienced,” and “Our customers could make purchasing decisions based on this experience,” and guests expressed excitement about the technology’s potential across the board.

“When our guests had the opportunity to experience this, they were wowed and had eyes widened with amazement. The experience is incredible – seeing the vehicle right in front of you with all of its details is truly unique,” Kittilä tells.

Participants felt the true immersion of the experience by attempting to interact physically with the virtual environment, reaching out to touch surfaces or press buttons as if engaging with a tangible object. These reactions suggest that users found the technology to be a convincing and engaging way to explore the vehicle in the absence of its physical model.

“Watching our guests use the headset was quite revealing. Observing their movements and reactions, it became apparent that they were experiencing something others couldn’t see, making you realize why the word ‘reality’ exists in ‘mixed reality’,” Kittilä remarks.

Kittilä and Autio both agree that seeing the car in virtual or mixed reality can ultimately help a customer make a purchase decision, particularly when they are considering different trims of a car or various colors: “Customers are always eager to see different variations of the car and the 3D model is realistic enough to allow them to see the differences effectively. It can extend the configuration process, allowing customers to see precisely what they are working with,” says Autio.

“It became apparent that they were experiencing something others couldn’t see, making you realize why the word ‘reality’ exists in ‘mixed reality’”

Mixed Reality Steps Beyond Automotive Design

Although numerous car brands already use virtual and mixed reality technologies as essential tools for designing and developing new models – with 16 out of the 20 largest global automotive manufacturers utilizing Varjo headsets in their operations – their application has primarily been limited to those specific departments.

Kia EV9’s Finland launch demonstrated a new use case in sales and PR for these 3D immersive models, opening doors to a range of potential uses within the automotive industry.

In addition to its potential as a powerful tool in executing marketing and PR showcases, one of the notable benefits of VR/XR technology is its potential to transform customer experiences and buying processes at dealerships. VR/XR experiences can enable efficient use of showroom space while allowing customers to visualize and get a feel for different car models, colors, and configurations without the vehicles physically being there. This not only enhances the customer experience but also efficiently utilizes often limited showroom space.

“Imagining the potential of deploying this technology in showrooms is exciting, as proven by these past two days of showcasing the Kia EV9,” Kittilä says.

“This allows customers to really see and feel the car without its physical presence, so the potential is undoubtedly there. We would love to see Kia adopt this as one of the strategic cornerstones moving forward.”

Why do I need such a powerful computer to use VR?

Virtual and mixed reality headsets can either be tethered to a computer or untethered. In the case of untethered devices, VR users can walk around freely without being attached to a computer. However, this comes with the caveat of significantly lower-quality graphics and visual fidelity.

Varjo headsets have a best-in-class resolution (measured in pixels per degree) and refresh rate, allowing VR and XR to be experienced in photorealistic quality. To run virtual and mixed reality content with that level of quality, a high-performance Graphical Processing Unit (GPU) and Central Processing Unit (CPU) are needed so the VR and XR experience is flawless and without jitters and frame drops.

Varjo headsets are compatible with a broad range of PCs, laptops, and workstations with NVIDIA GPUs. We partner with dozens of industry-leading manufacturers to test and certify their computers for optimal performance. Varjo’s VR and XR devices can also be used together with , our immersive streaming solution, which can lower the local computing requirements needed to power highest-fidelity immersive experiences.

FORCE Technology and Varjo Bring Game-Changing VR/XR Training to the Maritime Industry

March 18, 2024 – Helsinki, Finland / Copenhagen, Denmark – FORCE Technology, a leader in simulation-based maritime technology, engineering and training, and Varjo, the global technology leader in industrial-grade virtual and mixed reality hardware and software, have signed a strategic frame agreement. The partnership positions FORCE Technology as Varjo’s integrator partner, focusing on delivering advanced VR and XR training solutions to maritime customers worldwide.

The collaboration aims to launch a compact, highly portable, immersive training solution that can be transported and deployed anywhere. This solution represents a leap forward in maritime training accessibility and efficiency, significantly cutting down on the cost and logistical challenges associated with traditional maritime training methods.

Effective, Accessible, and Cost Reduced Training

The collaboration brings together FORCE Technology’s deep-rooted experience in maritime simulations and Varjo’s innovative mixed reality technology. The result is a training solution that not only cuts costs by a huge margin compared to traditional simulators but also boosts the quality of training with realistic immersive scenarios.

“We’re excited to take maritime training to the next level. The unparalleled visuals of the new Varjo XR-4 Series headsets, combined with our software and simulation know-how, will make this VR/XR solution a game-changer, offering flexibility and cost-savings the industry hasn’t seen before. Our aim is to bring effective training closer to the point of need, from classrooms to onboard ships,” says Capt. Jan Michelsen, FORCE Technology’s Simulation, Ports, Training and Human Factors Director.

Meeting the Needs in the Maritime Industry

The global maritime industry is currently facing a shortage of skilled seafarers, and there’s a pressing need for training solutions that are not just effective but also scalable and easy to deploy. FORCE Technology and Varjo’s immersive training solutions address these challenges head-on, making it easier for companies to train their crews efficiently and affordably.

“Our partnership with FORCE Technology is a big step towards the future of maritime training, making high-quality simulators more efficient and accessible. FORCE Technology’s immersive simulator will break down the old barriers for training, offering a more engaging and realistic simulation experience that brings about significant operational benefits for the industry,” says Seppo Aaltonen, Chief Commercial Officer at Varjo.

How National Highways Improves Road Safety Using Varjo Mixed Reality 

Traffic Officers are often faced with demanding and high-stress situations in their work, so preparing them through training is crucial.

VR solutions provider MXT is working with the UK’s highway authority, National Highways, to create a cutting-edge mixed reality driving simulator designed to help officers to better handle real-life scenarios while on patrol.

VR / XR TRAINING

National Highways is a United Kingdom government company which plans, designs, builds, operates and maintains England’s motorways and major A roads, known as the strategic road network. This means they patrol over 3500 miles (~5600 kilometers) of roads, so officers spend considerable hours behind the wheel and need to be able to rapidly respond to all kinds of demanding situations such as major accidents. 

This also places many demands on the officers. For example, they need to be able to execute professional driving maneuvers and techniques that are way beyond the requirements of most drivers. From driving safely along the hard shoulder of a motorway, to navigating their way through gridlocked traffic and even performing moving roadblocks, the job requires a significant level of individual skill. This presents major challenges to effectively training these professionals. 

The challenge: How to cost-effectively train officers for demanding scenarios 

So, how does National Highways keep their officer’s skills sharp without causing unnecessary expense to the taxpayers or causing too much disruption to other road users? For example, you simply can’t close down a section of a major highway for training purposes. This is exactly the challenge that the pioneering VR company MXT is working on with National Highways, developing a state-of-the-art mixed reality driver training simulator that can help prepare officers for what they might encounter out on patrol. 

“The challenge that National Highways have is that most of their most important scenarios are hard to replicate in the real world for various reasons,” explains , MXT’s Program Manager who is overseeing the development of the VR training simulator. Of course you can teach the theory in a classroom, but that can’t really replicate the stresses of being out on the road.  

For MXT, the challenge was how to develop a simulation that mixes the attributes of available technologies in a way that can deliver National Highways’ needs most effectively and appropriately. They initially considered using either 2D screens or purely VR training, but found that both technologies have their limitations when it comes to either immersivity or the ability to perform physical interactions.  

This is why MXT chose to explore mixed reality. “What XR allows you to do is split the difference and take the best of both approaches,” adds Thompson. “It puts the user in the car and allows them to interact with it as they would normally, but it also allows the trainer to control a simulated scenario, whilst keeping that vital sense of presence that is key to effective experiential training.” 

“The key for effective training is ensuring that the experience is as realistic as possible. The simulation needs to replicate the pressures of the job and make the user believe that there’s a sense of jeopardy.”

Josh Thompson

The solution: a mixed reality driving simulator 

As Traffic Officers work in high-pressure and high-stress environments, training plays a vital part in helping officers manage in these situations. To achieve this, MXT is creating a custom XR training experience that combines a Varjo headset, a motion rig and immersive sound design to put the user right behind the wheel. Once strapped in, a trainee will find themselves right behind the wheel of a National Highways’ Traffic Officer Vehicle (TOV), with access to all the controls, switches and buttons found in the real thing. From there, the user will be able to navigate a series of different road layouts. 

“Realism is the name of the game here, so we want to create an experience that approximates the real situation as close as we can,” says MXT’s Lead Programmer, Cat Flynn outlining the main technological hurdles the team are navigating as part of the build. “At the most basic level, if a driver needs to reverse and do that using only their side mirrors, we want them to be able to do that accurately. It is important that we get well into the weeds on this one and really understand what they need to do, how, and in what circumstances.” 

To ensure that National Highways have a tool that can help prep their officers for almost anything, MXT has sought to make an experience that’s as accessible and flexible as it possibly can be. In terms of hardware, the Varjo headsets ensure that the experience is as detailed and immersive as possible. Additionally MXT is collaborating with Motion Systems to create a state-of-the-art motion platform that replicates the conditions inside a National Highways’ TOV. 

On the software side, MXT’s in-house software has been designed with flexibility and utility in mind, in order to deliver the right service to the client quickly and effectively. For example, the team can swiftly build accurate sections of UK roads as needed, while the in-built traffic management and environmental tools allow the accurate recreation of most conditions – from a quiet stretch of the M62 at 4 AM to the roar of the M25 during a rainy Friday morning rush hour.  

The result: A highly immersive and flexible driving simulator experience 

The result is a training solution that is extremely malleable, cost-effective, and able to render large numbers of different scenarios and incorporate various levels of hazard. 

Right at the very heart of the project are the users themselves. While the simulation can deliver realistic scenarios that recreate most conditions, true effectiveness stems from its ability to break down the barriers between trainer teaching and trainee executing. Throughout the process, MXT is working hand in hand with Traffic Officer Trainers and ensuring that they feed back and shape the exact functionality they need.  

For MXT, the goal is to create a general-purpose tool that allows the trainer to craft their scenarios as much as possible. Once completed, it will be able to effectively replicate real-world situations, such as an overturned lorry or other common scenes. “These events are not always your average Tuesday for a Traffic Officer, but neither are they completely out the realms of possibility either, and I think the power of this tool is being able to strike the balance between the everyday experience of the user while providing enough immersion to demonstrate the importance of a job done well.” 

“It was vital that we worked with a headset that can deliver an experience as detailed and immersive as possible. The Varjo headset is without doubt the best.”

Mixed Reality Training in the Highest-Security Environments 

FlightSafety International, a leading provider of pilot training solutions, has adopted the Varjo Focal Edition mixed reality headset to enhance their flight simulation.

The ultimate close-up visual precision of the Focal Edition, along with its ability to meet strict security requirements, make it an ideal choice for FlightSafety International’s high-profile and high-security clientele.

Key benefits of VR & XR for FSI 

Many critical scenarios such as taxi, takeoff, landing, formation flight, and mission rehearsal can be trained easily and effectively with a smaller carbon footprint
Cost-effectively extends capabilities of existing cockpit training solutions instead of requiring full replacement
TAA compatibility and high-security of Varjo headsets enable deployment even to classified environments

Challenge: How to offer high-quality XR training in environments with the highest security requirements 

FlightSafety International (FSI) is the leading provider of pilot training services to the general aviation, corporate, military, and commercial airline markets. They work with high-profile customers in the industry, including the US Military and many foreign militaries in Europe and Asia, and manufacture some of the most advanced flight simulation solutions on the market.

In addition to fidelity and immersion requirements to effectively train pilots for demanding operations, high security is extremely important for governmental clients. However, consumer-oriented headsets very often struggle with these requirements because their hardware and software has not been built with this kind of security in mind. 

In the case of the United States, most headsets available on the market are also not TAA (Trade Agreements Act) compliant, so they can’t be used for large, high-security U.S. deployments.

This is one of the reasons why FSI chose to partner with Varjo. It allows them to combine their leading simulation solutions with the most security-conscious headsets available to offer next generation mixed reality flight training for high security environments. Furthermore, they can offer a fully TAA-compliant solution for the most demanding scenarios and deployments. 

Solution: A Top-of-the-Line XR Simulation Solution with the Highest-Fidelity Hardware and Software 

FSI’s VITAL 3D Image Generator couples the highest fidelity, photorealistic, FAA certified synthetic environments with the immersion of extended reality technologies. FSI’s latest advancements add mixed reality into the scenario, which allows combining the tactile benefit of a cockpit with an immersive virtual training environment. To further enhance the high fidelity and near-focus vision capabilities in their training solutions, FlightSafety International has also adopted Varjo’s Focal Edition mixed reality headset. With these advancements, FlightSafety’s Mixed Reality Flight solution offers a highly-effective 360 degree cockpit training device that is also cost-effective.  

This system is far more immersive and effective for training than virtual reality trainers because it allows users to see and interact with the real world inside the cockpit while adding a virtual world outside. Furthermore, the system can be integrated into an existing cockpit training device, so it does not require full replacement of existing trainers. 

“We introduced the Varjo Focal Edition headset StartFragment on our MR deviceEndFragment to a military customer recently and they really appreciate the ability to see something within that 45-centimeter focal range, specifically their avionics. They appreciate the ability to reach out and tactically feel or touch that knob or that button or their iPad which they may use as their electronic flight bag”, says Chad StartFragment SchmitzEndFragment , the Product Manager for Mixed Reality Flight at Flight Safety International. 

When training with FSI’s solution, the pilot wears the Varjo mixed reality headset, so they can enjoy the highest fidelity available. This allows clearer readability of cockpit elements and a crisp resolution for the virtual world. The system allows for extended trainability and situational awareness including taxi, takeoff, landing, formation flight, mission rehearsal and more.  

“We think it’s important to see clearly, specifically the avionics panel, the instruments within the flight deck itself, because that lends to increased flight training proficiency,” StartFragment Schmitz EndFragment says. 

The benefits are not limited to the pilot, though. The system also allows adding two additional visual displays, allowing instructors to see what the student sees. The instructor benefits from integrated eye tracking, displaying pilot gaze and scan patterns in the real and virtual worlds.  

“The initial feedback on the Varjo Focal Edition has been positive. The users enjoy the ability to see things close, specifically the avionics panel.”

 Product Manager for Mixed Reality Flight at Flight Safety International

Outcome: Better, More Secure Training for Pilots 

By partnering with Varjo, FlightSafety International can offer industry-leading mixed reality training solutions for even the most demanding pilot training scenarios.

The solution is cost-effective, and allows combining the tactile elements of the physical cockpit with the immersive digital scenario produced by VITAL 3D, making sure pilots train with maximal immersion. The Focal Edition allows trainees to see close-up details, such as the avionics panel and electronic flight bag, in realistic, human-eye resolution, which is crucial for effective pilot training.

The solution also allows the instructor to efficiently monitor the trainee, seeing what they see. Varjo’s integrated eye tracking enables accurate monitoring and recording of the pilot’s gaze and scan patterns, allowing even more precise instructions and development of the pilot’s abilities.

Meeting the Highest Security Requirements

FlightSafety International has clients in the military that require the highest level of security in all aspects of their operation. Thanks to the security-conscious approach of Varjo headsets and the ability to produce them with full TAA compliance – and even disable radio signals entirely – the solution can be deployed even in locations that have the strictest of security requirements.

The Focal Edition allows FlightSafety International to meet these demands. The immersive mixed reality training solution can be deployed even in locations that have the strictest security requirements.

“With the Focal Edition, we’re able to give them that high level of security as we can use an offline license so there’s no connection to the Internet,” StartFragment SchmitzEndFragment says.

Dive into the possibilities that VR and XR technology can bring to pilot training and flight simulation:

Refresh Rate

Refresh rate refers to the maximum number of fresh images a device can display in one second. The higher the rate is, the smoother the image feels. 

In VR or XR headsets, a high refresh rate is key in creating a realistic immersive experience. If the refresh rate is low, the user can experience nausea, cyber sickness, and discomfort, as the virtual reality environment can look laggy and less realistic. A high enough rate, on the other hand, allows VR and XR users to be immersed in the virtual or mixed reality environment without discomfort or choppiness, especially when combined with other crucial features such as a high resolution, wide field of view, and high frame rate (of the VR or XR software application). When these features are on an optimal level, the user can fully focus on the immersive experience itself and forget about the technology.

In all Varjo VR and XR headsets, the refresh rate is 90 Hz, meaning that the image can be refreshed 90 times per second for the user.

Capturing VR or XR experiences

Did you know that you can easily capture and share videos of the VR / XR headset experience with Varjo Base’s Record function? If you want to share your experiences with others, you can take screenshots or short videos of the virtual reality or mixed reality experience simply by pressing the ‘Record’ button available in Varjo Base. The video file is saved in the Videos > Varjo folder on your Windows computer. While these 2D depictions do great job of demonstrating the intended content, they can never convey the full visual experience of actually wearing the headset.

Capturing and portraying what a user actually sees through the lens when wearing a virtual or mixed reality headset (HMD) can be very difficult. It is hard to account for the effect that the specific HMDs have on the experience, missing for example the lens quality or field of view.

Nothing compares to the immersive experience of wearing the HMD in-person but taking a photograph inside the headset is perhaps the next best thing. Framing the image from the perspective of a user captures the combined experience of the visual content and the hardware’s delivery of said content.

However, capturing a true-to-life image ‘through the lens’ does take a certain amount of expertise. When done badly, imperfections such as chromatic aberration or soft focus generated from the use of the camera, can give an unwarranted poor representation of the actual visual fidelity of the device in question.

The ultra-high visual fidelity of Varjo HMDs is unparalleled in today’s VR/XR market, and care should be taken to do justice to the visceral experience of VR/XR with Varjo.

We will help you set up tracking for your headset.

SteamVR™ Tracking is available for XR-3, VR-3, Aero, VR-2 Pro, VR-2, XR-1 Developer Edition, and VR-1. XR-4 Base station tracking versions also support SteamVR™ tracking. For other options, see the list of available tracking methods.

Positional tracking for your headset

Your Varjo headset uses a tracking system to know its exact position. Tracking allows applications to synchronize your movements in the real world with those in the virtual environment.

Varjo headsets support SteamVR Tracking, which uses up to four SteamVR base stations to track your headset. If your application uses controllers, those can be tracked as well.

Set up SteamVR™ Tracking

Follow these steps to set up SteamVR™ Tracking for your headset. Before you set up tracking, you will need to start setup in Varjo Base and connect your headset.

1. Install the SteamVR application

Download and install SteamVR to get started. SteamVR is the software required to use SteamVR™ Tracking.

2. Prepare your environment to use the headset safely

Before using the headset, clear the room of obstacles and hazards, people, furniture, and any other items to ensure that youhave enough spacebothabove and around you.

If possible, cover all reflective surfaces since they may interfere with tracking. Make sure that you have good lighting in the room when you set up and use the headset.

Read more about how to prepare your environment.

3. Choose the positions for the base stations

You can use either SteamVR™ base stations 1.0 or 2.0.

Recommended distances between the devices are:

A minimum of 1.5 m (5 ft) between each base station and the headset.
A maximum of 5 m (16 ft) between base stations.

Four base stations 2.0 are recommended if you plan to move around the room.
Two base stations 2.0 or 1.0 are sufficient for sitting and stationary use.

4. Mount the base stations

Mount the base stations at a minimum height of 2 m (6.5 ft) and angled down 30–45 degrees.

Make sure the base stations have a direct line of sight with the headset, even when moving around the room.

Note: If you use SteamVR™ 1.0 base stations, ensure that the base stations have a direct line of sight both with the headset and each other.

Use the wall-mounting kit (included in the box) or a tripod (not included). For additional instructions, check the manufacturer’s guide on how to use the mounting kit (PDF).

5. Plug in the base stations

Two different power plugs are included in the box (European type C and North American type A). Use a standard power adapter if needed.

6. Set the channels for your base stations

A. Setting channels for base stations 2.0

You can recognize this model by the rounded front panel.

Use a paper clip to operate the Mode button on the back of the device.
Check the status area in Varjo Base to see the current channel for each base station.
Set each base station to a different channel (between 1 and 16). Each press of the button advances the channel selection by one.

B. Setting channels for base stations 1.0 

You can recognize this model by the rectangular shape of the device.

Press the Mode button on the back of the device to change the channel. The current channel is displayed on the front.
Set the channels according to how many base stations you are using:

1 base station = a
2 base stations = b + c

7.  Check the tracking status in Varjo Base

Varjo Base will display the status of your devices. Check the icons in the status area to confirm that your headset and base stations are connected and that tracking is working.

If headset tracking is not working, make sure that the headset has a direct line of sight with the base stations and that the front plate of the headset is not covered.

Tip: SteamVR tracking elements are located behind the front plate of your headset. Make sure that the base stations are pointing towards the headset’s front plate in all positions, including when moving or turning around in the room. The minimum recommended distance between the base stations and the headset is 1.5 m (5 ft). Please be aware that reflective surfaces may interfere with tracking and should be covered if possible.

8.  Set up your room in SteamVR

When using your Varjo headset for the first time in a new environment, you will need to perform a brief setup to configure the headset and base stations.

Perform this setup each time you move the headset and base stations to a new environment, or if you move the base stations or change their orientation in your current room.

From the SteamVR room setup instructions, select Launch SteamVR and wait for the application to open. Alternatively, you can manually open SteamVR on your Windows computer.
In the SteamVR application window, go to Menu > Room setup and follow the instructions. We recommend you choose the Standing Only setup, which is the most straightforward option.
After completing room setup, return to Varjo Base.

You can start room setup again at any time in Varjo Base by navigating to the System tab and SteamVR room setup.

9.  Optional: Pair your controller(s)

When using Varjo headsets with SteamVR™ Tracking, you can use any SteamVR™ compatible controllers. Please note that Varjo Controllers are not compatible with SteamVR™Tracking

Note: If you have previously paired your controllers with another VR headset, they will need to be paired again with your Varjo headset.

Switch on your controller(s).
From the Pair SteamVR devices instructions, select Launch SteamVR and wait for the application to open. Alternatively, you can manually open SteamVR on your Windows computer.
In the SteamVR application window, go to Menu > Devices > Pair Controller and follow the instructions.
After completing the pairing, return to Varjo Base.

You can pair devices again at any time in Varjo Base by navigating to the System tab and Pair SteamVR device.

10.  Enable the OpenVR runtime if prompted (XR-3 only)

Varjo Base will attempt to automatically enable the OpenVR runtime for XR-3. If you have previously used an OpenVR-compatible headset on this computer, you may be prompted to enable the runtime manually.

Enable the OpenVR runtime if you want to run OpenVR applications, such as SteamVR apps.

SteamVR™ Tracking is now successfully set up and your headset is ready for use.

Product Design Story of the Varjo XR-4 Series: Next-Generation Headsets Optimized for Comfort and Usability

 by 
 Tuomas Nylén, Principal Industrial Designer, Varjo

Industrial design has been an integral part of building Varjo’s vision and product experiences from day one. We are in constant seek of balance between high performance hardware and human factors resulting unmatched immersive experience, packed in highly functional and well build physical form factor.

The design process of a high-tech product is a game of solving problems and balancing tradeoffs but always focusing on what is best for the end user. At Varjo, we shape the physical product experience by creating solutions for the identified problems through prototyping, validating results, and iterating to make the final products both ergonomic, usable, appealing and to meet the exacting standards in visual and tactile quality.

This blog post delves into design thinking that has driven the physical form, materials, and functional features of the Varjo XR-4 series headsets, designed to ensure that our products do not just perform exceptionally but also feel right when you use them.

DESIGN: FOUNDATIONS • COLOR INTENT • SOLID PRODUCT RANGE
ERGONOMICS: ADAPTIVE DESIGN FOR COMFORT • MINIMIZED PRESSURE AGAINST FACE • HEAD SUPPORTS AND OPTIMIZED WEIGHT BALANCE • ADJUSTMENT INTERFACE

Designed & Engineered for the End Users

Progressive Simplicity, Concealing High Complexity

In the XR-4 design, we wanted to create a product that communicates a sense of simplicity while concealing the vast technological complexity. At the core of the XR-4 device is the magnesium frame, a highly accurate mount for all the key hardware elements, cameras, sensors, and the mainboard.

The foundation for optical fidelity is the dual Aspheric optical lens and chamber design. The selected optics configuration resulted in prominent physical volume. We explored multiple ways to distribute both the physical and visual mass while designing as robust and light weight structure as possible simultaneously serving for heat dissipation and other required functions.

The chosen design direction is based on the approach where a robust and protective shell wraps around a delicate core. The resulting product design aims to embody a progressive form language, precisely controlled dimensions, sculpted shapes, and well-balanced details.

One of the most significant visual differences in the XR-4 design compared to previous all-black Varjo product generations is the color direction of the XR-4 series.

The body parts’ dual-tone color scheme, where the black core parts interfaces the user’s head are layered under the light grey shell, contributes to the same design goal as the form factor – The intention of dividing and balancing the overall visual volume.

Also, the approach creates a clear visual hierarchy that contributes both for product’s usability and the visual balance.

From the beginning, one of the noticeable visual elements for Varjo headsets has been mirror front face. It is a distinctive element that stands out from the crowd, manifests the Varjo’s hi-tech identity and makes the product’s character alive by reflecting the surrounding environment, objects, and spectators.

Solid Design Through the Product Range

The XR-4 series peripheral range, including the chargers, adapters, cables, and controllers are crafted with the same attention to detail and for the uncompromised user experience as the headset.

The controllers were designed in collaboration with Razer, whose design team brought vast expertise on refining controllers.

The connectivity peripherals’ pure design language makes them highly functional. As none of the products are off-the-shelf items, we managed to enhance the user experience by injecting novel solutions for practical problems.

As for example, the cable plugs and matching connector interface in headset and adapter share a novel anti-detach feature, preventing unintentional unplugging and securing the connections.

Benchmark For Pro-Grade Comfort

Focus On Highly Adaptive Design

In ergonomics design a primary focus area was to provide an ergonomic solution for multi-user and shared device use contexts. For that, instead of creating a range of various changeable parts, we harnessed our skills and experience on the clear goal to design a product that fits for all heads.

In practice this converts to a highly adaptive headband design where the adjustments and contact points against the head accommodate for broad range of head sizes, shapes, and face topologies.

Zero Pressure On Face

One of the key problems we identified and focused on tackling in the XR-4 design was the pressure against sensitive face areas, familiar to all ski-goggle type face cushion designs. In Varjo’s previous product generation, we introduced a tilt adjustment helping to ease the pressure at the nose surroundings and cheek area.

Yet, based on the user feedback and design validation, we decided to pivot to a different approach. In the XR-4 series the face interface combines traditional foam and PU leather cushion part and a light blocking mask injection molded of silicon. The solution guarantees pressure points being applied to the forehead area only, while the sensitive areas of the face remain intact.

The carefully shaped thin and silky feel material keeps the ambient light away from the optics, adapts to various face shapes and thus feels super comfortable throughout the use session. The flexible material also eases the fit with eyeglasses when putting the headset on or taking off and during use by removing potential pressure feel from temples area.

Head Supports Inspired by Frame Structures

The other crucial part for comfort was providing sufficient support and fit on the back and top of the head. We decided to improve the well-acknowledged pad design of the previous generation XR-3 product. During the process we were inspired by airplane frame structures and contemporary office chair designs, both targeting lightweight and firm, yet elastic structures. As an outcome the XR-4 series head pads are a combination of elastic frame, firm cushion foam, synthetic textile mesh and a swivel joint suspension. The chosen materials and structural design are contributing for optimal support, adaptivity and maximum heat dissipation during the use.

Weight can be considered one of the most important comfort factors in any wearable devices, especially head mounted displays. With all the inbuilt tech, the uncompromised dual aspheric optics, hardware and cameras, the total weight of the front section adds up to 665 grams (about 1.47 Lb). We prototyped and validated different weight reduction options, resulting in the realization that the total sum of weight is not the ultimate deal breaker, instead, how the weight is distributed around the head is what matters in prolonged use sessions. For that we added counterbalancing weight on the back section of the device, easing the front heaviness and making the overall feel highly balanced.

Swift Adjustments – A Quick Lane Into Full Immersion

The adaptiveness theme in design is further articulated in three other key features in XR-4 series products. To get the best visual quality delivered by the optics, the correct eye interpupillary distance is the key element. Like our previous generation devices, adjustment is fully automated (auto-IPD) from the user standpoint, no single action is needed when the headset is put on head.

The ability to quickly and comfortably enter or exit immersion makes the headset an effortless extension of the user’s natural workflow. Instead of tightening the headband by rotating the back wheel multiple times we wanted to enhance the user experience. User can release the headband by pushing the “quick release” latch down at the back adjustment interface. The quick release feature is easy to operate, and it significantly shortens the putting headset on and taking off sequences.

Globally more than half of the adult population use some form of vision correction. Given the fact, we wanted to enhance the compatibility with eyewear but beyond that, support accommodation of different facial topologies. We designed an adjustment system which enables a snappy and effortless way to adjust the lens eye distance, called the field-of-view adjustment. This allows users to adjust the lens distance from the eyes enabling both space for eyewear, and customization of the achievable field-of-view benefiting every user. A simple button press-and-hold while moving the headset body forth and back gives ultra-fast lane for the best immersion.

Capturing VR or XR experiences

Controllers

Most VR or XR applications require controllers to interact with the virtual content. Hand-held controllers allow you to interact with certain objects within the application, such as “touching” something in virtual reality, picking up a virtual object, or interacting with objects with your hands or fingers in other ways, just as you would with your hands in real life. The VR controllers come in various shapes and designs, with varying levels of user ergonomics and precision.

Sometimes, controllers are not required as certain VR devices have built-in hand-tracking capabilities. This will enable you to extend and use your hands to select objects instead of using separate handheld devices. For example, when it comes to Varjo XR-4 Series, all but Secure Edition XR-4 devices come with in-box Varjo Controllers, powered by Razer, to enable high-precision interactions with virtual contents as well as high tactile immersion. Controllers are also available for purchase for all customers.

Varjo XR-4 Series headsets also come in Steam variants on request. These headsets work together with all SteamVR™ compatible controllers. You can use one or two, depending on the needs of your application and its interactions. You can find more details on supported models and their compatibility here.

Positional Tracking

Positional tracking refers to a system in a VR/XR headset that determines its exact position. Tracking allows applications to synchronize your movements in the real world with those in the virtual environment, in real time.

Without proper tracking, if you try to lean or move your head’s position, it would not be tracked, and the entire virtual world would move with it, creating an unrealistic, bad virtual experience and causing cybersickness. Correct positional tracking of your headset is key to achieving a fully immersive experience.

There are multiple ways in which proper tracking can be executed. Varjo headsets achieve this in the following ways:

Varjo inside-out tracking uses the built-in cameras of your headset to scan the room and keep track of your head’s position. Varjo inside-out tracking is available for all Varjo XR-4 Series headsets.
SteamVR™ tracking uses up to four SteamVR™ base stations (or “lighthouses”) to track your headset and optional controllers. SteamVR™ tracking is available for Varjo headsets of older generations. In addition to that, Varjo XR-4 Series headsets are available in Steam variants on request which allows for the use of SteamVR™ base stations.
Third-party tracking methods, such as ART or OptiTrack, can be integrated with all Varjo headsets.

Varjo & Boeing: A New Era in Astronaut Training using Virtual Reality

With Varjo, the Boeing Starliner program unlocks an entirely new way for astronauts to prepare for spaceflight. Varjo allows astronaut training – 

from pre-launch to docking to landing – entirely in VR for the first time.

Transcending the way astronauts are trained

When astronauts prepare for crewed space missions, every step of the flight is practiced thousands of times. Although launching a spacecraft from zero to orbit takes only 12 minutes, it requires years of preparation and hundreds of hours of complex training simulations. For the mission to be successful, everything needs to go flawlessly. This is why the Boeing Starliner flight-test crew in Houston is always looking for new, innovative ways to train astronauts.

Boeing CST-100 Starliner capsule approaching International Space Station. Boeing has built the spacecraft for all of NASA’s crewed space endeavors, including Mercury, Gemini, Apollo, the space shuttle and International Space Station (ISS) and now the Starliner.

Connie Miller is a programmer at Boeing Starliner with almost two decades of experience supporting Boeing space programs with new technologies. The Boeing Starliner is developed in partnership with NASA and is designed for researchers and adventurers alike.

Right now, Miller is responsible for progressing the virtual reality training efforts in the Starliner program. Her goal is to set up the team to be able to train astronauts for every step of the mission using immersive technologies.

While NASA’s astronauts have been training for spacewalks in VR for years, the low resolution of existing VR devices has meant that training for the full spectrum of safety-critical scenarios, including operating the spacecraft and docking with the ISS, has not been possible – until now.

When the first crewed mission aboard CST-100 Starliner takes place, the crew will have banked hundreds of training hours for each phase of the entire mission – including launching, docking, re-entering the atmosphere and landing phases – using Varjo’s human-eye resolution VR devices.

The VR headset provides a clear, high resolution system so that the crew can read instruments from a normal distance, which vital to effective astronaut training.

 “Being able to read the crew displays with a VR headset from a normal position in the capsule was mandatory. Without that, we were really stuck – until we found a headset that worked.”

CONNIE MILLER – Software Engineer, BOEING

Effective training requires crystal-clear vision

The crew console in the CST-100 Starliner has two display panels that show in real time the velocity and trajectory of the aircraft as it moves in space.

Connie Miller and spaceflight training software engineer Jim May have been exploring the possibility of using VR for astronaut training since 2017, but until last year, the immersive training opportunities were still limited.

But the ambition level was high. Boeing developers in Australia had 3-D modeled the Starliner console using Unreal Engine. In Houston, the virtual training applications were integrated to the physical simulators. Meanwhile, Miller and her colleagues took on the task of testing all available VR devices on the market.

Astronauts need crystal-clear vision to be able to read the display panels in the capsule. The spacecraft’s crew console consists of two displays, each about the size of an iPad, which show mission-critical flight data such as the velocity and trajectory of the aircraft as it moves in space.

For the VR training to be effective, astronauts need to be able to read all the displays simultaneously while operating the simulated aircraft with their hands or controllers. With earlier VR headsets, reading the displays in the immersive training environment was only possible when leaning in close to the displays – but then the astronauts couldn’t see their hands, making it unsuitable for training.

With the human-eye resolution in Varjo headsets, astronauts can see the smallest of details on the crew console. For the Boeing Starliner program, this unlocks unprecedented virtual reality training opportunities for a crewed space mission.

When using Varjo’s human-eye resolution virtual reality, astronauts are able to read all the mission-critical data in the immersive training environment. The crew console has been 3-D modeled using Unreal Engine. Varjo & Boeing: A New Era in Astronaut Training using Virtual Reality

 “The simulators ensure that the crew is able to train for all aspects of their mission safely.”

STEVEN SICELOFF – Boeing Communications, International Space Station/Lunar Exploration

Most demanding training is now possible in VR

Boeing's software engineer Connie Miller with the Varjo VR headset. Whether training for simulated emergency scenarios – or virtual launching, docking, entry or landing – astronauts need to keep their focus just as they would in real life. And they need to act fast and understand their options.

Docking to the International Space Station is one of the most complex operations of a Starliner mission, and is one example of the training scenarios now possible in the immersive VR environment.

Imagine approaching the ISS in the Starliner spacecraft. Your speed is relatively low, but the ISS weighs about 420,000 kilograms. That’s the equivalent of more than 330 automobiles. And even though the ISS is weightless in space, it still has mass. And the spacecraft needs to be steered to a fine point at the docking port by following a cone-shaped path. Projecting the display panels and trajectory data precisely is crucial if VR is to be an effective training tool for such a vital operation.

Varjo’s visual fidelity not only makes it possible to train for precise procedures such as docking, but to practice for unplanned events. VR training allows the Starliner crew to simulate dangerous situations, and build the team’s responses and decision-making abilities, without ever putting the astronauts in danger.

Using VR simulators, the team can perform all the interactions, voice and switch commands, while being immersed in the same surroundings they’d see when sitting in the actual spacecraft.

Ultimately this adds to the safety of the mission.

Docking to the ISS is one of the most complex operations of a Starliner mission, and is one example of the training scenarios now possible in the immersive VR environment.

VR brings operational benefits – even under exceptional circumstances

Chris Ferguson, Commander of the Starliner spacecraft. The Starliner is setting the foundation for commercial passenger spaceflight services to and from low-Earth orbit.

Augmenting astronaut training with virtual reality has immense operational benefits for Boeing and the Starliner program. Before exploring virtual training, Boeing’s Starliner crew has trained in two state-of-the-art fixed simulators in Houston, with very powerful computers and electronic hardware. Virtual reality allows astronauts to train remotely from anywhere in the world.

With Varjo’s VR devices, astronauts can participate in training sessions remotely, with the same level of realism and interactions as if they were sitting in the physical simulators. The Starliner crew can also perform VR simulations in their individual part-task trainers from anywhere in the world. This brings operational flexibility for the entire team.

Virtual reality also unlocks the ability for astronauts to train while in pre-launch quarantine in crew quarters, which is not possible with more conventional training systems.

With the software development largely behind them, the Boeing team is making its final evaluations and crews are set to begin using the headset full-time in their training.

 “The ability to connect and jointly train astronauts from various countries, agencies, and private partnerships will be especially important as human spaceflight becomes more commercialized and accessible to everyone.”

JIM MAY – Spaceflight Training Software Engineer, BOEING

CHRIS FERGUSON – Commander of the Starliner Spacecraft, BOEING

 When the first crewed mission aboard CST-100 Starliner takes place,

the crew will have banked hundreds of training hours for each phase 

of the entire mission using Varjo’s human-eye resolution VR devices.

Never-before-seen remote training opportunities

Jim May, Boeing’s Spaceflight Training Software Engineer, with the Varjo headset. Varjo & Boeing: A New Era in Astronaut Training using Virtual Reality

In the future, the Boeing Starliner team’s ambitions for VR training are likely to reach even greater heights. According to Connie Miller, the team would like to enable flight crews to take the VR training system into orbit aboard the Starliner. This would mean never-before-seen remote training – conducting VR simulations from outer space.

Before this, though, the Boeing Starliner program’s pioneering work in VR simulations is likely to be applied to other safety-critical scenarios.

VR training translates well to other vehicles as well. This platform could potentially be used on other Boeing aircraft.

 “We are proud to be delivering the technology that is pushing industrial training applications to their furthest reaches.”

Setting up XR-4

You will need a Varjo Account to use XR-4. Two account types are available:

Commercial accounts are for commercial purposes.
Personal accounts are intended for personal use.

Choose the account type that best fits your needs.

Follow these steps to set up your headset.

1. Log into Varjo Account Portal

To get started, log into Varjo Account Portal. If you don’t have a Varjo Account yet, you can create a Varjo Account.

2. Download Varjo Base from Varjo Account Portal

Varjo Base is the software used to run your headset. It contains everything you need to use the headset on a Windows computer, including advanced presentation and developer tools.

Note that Varjo Base 4.0 or later is required to use XR-4. If you have an older version of Varjo Base, please download and install the latest version.

When you install Varjo Base for the first time, you may be prompted to also install Microsoft Visual C++ 2019 X64 Minimum Runtime.

3. Start Varjo Base

Varjo Base will help you set up your headset. You can also follow along the setup steps on this page.

When you start Varjo Base for the first time, we will run a system check to confirm that your computer is compatible with the headset. See System requirements for more information.

4. Log into Varjo Base with your Varjo Account

Depending on your commercial package, you may be asked to log in.

In Varjo Base, log in with your Varjo Account to start setup.

If your company has enabled Microsoft single sign-on with Varjo, you can also login using Microsoft SSO.

Note that your computer needs to be connected to the internet to log in.

5. Select your headset model

When you start Varjo Base for the first time, it will automatically open the first-time user guide to help you through the setup process. You can open the guide at any time in the Support tab under Run setup.

Select your headset model to view detailed instructions on how to connect your headset.

See the cabling in more detail.
6. Connect your headset and charge the controllers

When you connect the headset to your computer for the first time, Windows will recognize the headset as a new USB device and install the appropriate drivers.

Connect power to the headset adapter using the charging cable. Use the 60W port in the 3-port charger.
Make sure the charging cable locks into place properly.

Shaping the Future of Steel Production Training: Tata Steel's Pioneering Use of VR with Steel Sim VR and Varjo

Tata Steel, in collaboration with Steel Sim VR and Varjo, is paving the way for a safer, more efficient future for industrial training. Their state-of-the-art virtual reality simulator for crane operator training not only improves safety and reduces costs but also catalyzes industry-wide digital transformation.

Tata Steel, a flagship company of the India-based Tata Group, stands among top global steel producers with operations and commercial presence across the globe.

Tata Steel’s IJmuiden Works in the Netherlands is a vital cog in this vast steel empire. Situated in the port town of IJmuiden, the plant plays a critical role in the European steel industry producing approximately seven million tons of steel annually to diverse markets, including the automotive, construction, and packaging industries.

Benefits of VR in Steel Production Training:

Enhanced Safety: Offering a safe platform for learning, even for high-risk scenarios and uncommon automation fails
Cost-Effectiveness: One-time investment yielding long-term benefits and significantly reducing training costs
Time Efficiency: Operators can begin hands-on training from day one, eliminating the need for continuous mentorship and saving countless hours of training
Quick Evaluation: Expediting the process of assessing a prospective operator’s suitability for the job
Attracting New Employees: The use of cutting-edge technology in training can be a compelling draw for potential hires

Navigating the High-Risk Landscape of Steel Production

Steel production is inherently associated with a multitude of high-risk operations and scenarios. The production process, which involves melting metal at extremely high temperatures, can be hazardous, as workers are often exposed to extreme heat, molten metal, and heavy vessels and machinery. Any misstep or spillage during this operation can have catastrophic implications.

With safety being a vital concern in the industry, Tata Steel has been pioneering in automating many aspects of their steel plants’ operations. Yet, as is always the case with machinery, failures can occur, necessitating manual override of the automation. This poses a significant challenge as operators are often inexperienced in manual procedures, given the typically reliable nature of the automation.

Due to the complexity and inherent risks of production processes, it’s vital that crane operators undergo comprehensive training that equips them with hands-on experience to swiftly react in any scenarios they may come across. To evolve from the traditional and often time-consuming apprentice-style route of training new drivers, transitioning into a virtual environment was the next logical step for Tata Steel’s IJmuiden Works. When securing funding for their digital transformation presented a challenge, the steelworks took matters into their own hands – and the solution turned out to be closer than they could have imagined.

A Partnership Driving Efficiency and Safety in Crane Operator Training

As luck would have it, Tata Steel’s IJmuiden Works discovered the potential of a local solutions provider, Steel Sim VR, situated just ten kilometers away from their premises. With a proven track record, having successfully constructed a crane simulator for Tata Steel at Port Talbot, UK, and StartFragment ArcelorMittal Gent and Bremen, EndFragment Steel Sim VR emerged as the ideal partner for spearheading the shift towards virtual training. Capitalizing on this opportunity, Tata Steel’s IJmuiden Works entered a collaboration with Steel Sim VR, leading to the creation of an innovative digital model of their loading crane.

Established in 2018, Steel Sim VR was born from a one-off project to develop a lean and efficient VR-based training tool for the steel industry. The company aims to revolutionize crane operator training by replacing the dangerous, costly, and time-consuming traditional training methods with safer and more streamlined virtual simulations. “We were one of the first to incorporate virtual reality into this type of simulation training,” explains Jan Luc Zandjans, Co-Founder of Steel Sim VR.

The exceptional clarity and comfort of the Varjo headset enabled users to undertake training for extended periods comfortably, making it the perfect choice as the cornerstone for their training solutions. “Upon testing Varjo, we found it to be the best option available, so it was an easy decision to choose the most advanced headset for training personnel. We were amazed, as nothing else we had seen could compare to it,” Zandjans says.

“The virtual reality simulation is an exact copy of what happens in real life. The simulation feels just like operating an actual crane.”

Inside Tata Steel's Innovative VR Simulator

The collaboration between Tata Steel and Steel Sim VR paved the way for a state-of-the-art VR-based simulator designed to emulate training in a real-life crane cabin. Thanks to the Varjo Aero headset, everything inside the virtual cabin is crystal clear and easy to see, including details such as various screens for tasks, text and number displays, cabin buttons and joysticks. “With Varjo, we were able to create a lifelike cabin for our training simulators, which truly enhances the overall training experience,” says Zandjans.

Once the VR simulator is fully operational at Tata Steel’s IJmuiden Works, the training program is divided into two categories: one for newcomers and the other for experienced operators. The novice operators will receive basic training, while the more seasoned ones will go through a refresher course, and both groups will be trained in handling special emergency incidents, such as automation failures or breakouts. The simulation mimics the actual crane movement precisely, helping operators gain invaluable muscle memory for when such incidents occur.

“The virtual reality simulation is an exact copy of what happens in real life. Once the headset is on, you feel as though you’re actually inside the steel factory,” says Hans Pronk, Steel Making Operational Expert at Tata Steel Europe. “The feedback from our crane operators, particularly those with extensive experience, has been overwhelmingly positive.”

Another central feature of the solution is its innovative data dashboard tracking metrics of the trainee’s performance. This tool breaks down scenarios into specific tasks and goals, while recording a trainee’s ‘flight path’ to provide insightful feedback on their movements. Using a variety of data points, operators can integrate this data with a reporting system to analyze trends and identify problematic areas. For example, the data dashboard can answer queries like ‘Which scenario results in the most collisions?’.

“There's no comparison to the safety offered by high-quality simulator training.”

Training Capabilities Beyond Comparison

The benefits of the VR solution are manifold. Firstly, the simulator offers an environment for practicing disaster scenarios, a training module previously lacking in the training repertoire across the industry. With the simulator, operators can practice situations they couldn’t safely prepare for in a real-life setting.

Furthermore, simulator training is multiple times more cost-effective and efficient compared to traditional methods. It allows an operator to start training independently from day one, saving time and money compared to traditional crane training, where a mentor or an experienced crane driver needs to be present with a less experienced one. “After several hours of training on the simulator, an operator is already prepared to work on the actual crane with a colleague. Consequently, we anticipate that this system will lead to significant reductions in training time,” says Tata Steel’s expert Hans Pronk.

One of the benefits of this technology is its flexibility. The initial investment is made once, but the benefits continue year after year. “You can easily switch to another application or environment without making any significant investment in hardware; the only required investment is in software,” Pronk explains.

Propelling the Industry into the Future

Tata Steel’s leap into VR signaled the company’s readiness to embrace future innovation, proving that the steel industry was no longer a stranger to digital transformation. Advancements in recent technology have evolved immersive solutions into a new model of cost-effectiveness, paving the way for their widespread adoption across the industry. “We now have all the necessary hardware and software to build top-quality simulators at competitive prices,” says Zandjans. “This development has made the choice between traditional training and simulator training much easier for our clients.”

Steel Sim VR sees a strong future for immersive training solutions in the steel industry, similar to the extensive adoption seen in the aviation field. “Without a doubt, training simulators are set to become the new standard for training personnel, especially in tasks involving heavy machinery and hazardous environments”, says Zandjans. “I anticipate that within the next five years, simulators will be the standard training method in the industry.”

IPD

IPD is short for inter-pupillary distance, the distance between your pupils or the centers of your eyes. The reason it matters is that this distance can vary from person to person, and incorrect IPD can cause issues such as cybersickness or not being able to achieve that maximum clarity and field of view in VR or XR headsets. Most headsets offer the option of adjusting to your own interpupillary distance, so that you can achieve this ideal image quality, tailored to your eyes.

All Varjo headsets feature automatic interpupillary distance adjustment (or “auto-IPD”).  This means that the device automatically tailors the IPD for different users without them having to adjust it manually. The headset will automatically move the lenses left or right to match the distance between the wearer’s eyes. This is a lot more reliable method of adjusting the distance and ensures that the VR/XR experience is optimal for each user. As an example, all Varjo XR-4 Series devices are able to adjust the IPD automatically between 56 and 72 mm.

In exceptional circumstances, for example when wearing varifocal lenses, the automatic adjustment may not result in the optimal position. If so, you can also set the IPD manually in Varjo Base.

Case Kia: Driving the Future with XR Collaboration in Car Design

Kia Motors has always been an industry leader when it comes to implementing new and innovative tech in their design process.

Now, with Varjo supported by Autodesk VRED, Kia’s visualization process can move to a totally immersive photorealistic environment. And that means global design reviews can go from days to an hour.

Photorealistic, real-scale and hands-on – Seeing is believing

Save vast amounts of time, work and money with virtual design reviews
Do more effective visualization work with XR

There’s magic happening in the Europe Design Center of Kia Motors – the South Korean automotive company. Thomas Unterluggauer is the center’s Creative Manager CGI. He’s wearing the Varjo mixed reality headset as he works on a Kia model in the studio; moving seamlessly between the real and virtual car in front of him, and making changes on the fly. 

What he’s seeing and doing in the Kia studio hasn’t been possible until now. Welcome to the new reality.

Kia’s European design studio, led by (in the picture), is a pioneer in integrating new technologies into their design workflow. With a digital 3D department, design teams and visualization experts, its goal is to always exceed expectations – both for Kia customers and the company’s leadership in South Korea.

When Kia’s European team tried out Varjo’s VR headset for the first time, they were blown away by the clarity and the resolution compared to all other headsets.

“For the first time, we could literally see the metallic flakes in the paint and perceive the depth and quality of the material shaders. We could see the beauty of the details more than ever before in the virtual world. Varjo is the only device capable of this level of clarity and sharpness,” Unterluggauer says.

Seeing more details in the car exterior was a breakthrough. But when Unterluggauer and the team got to explore the Varjo mixed reality device, they realized they could also use it to take their design work to new heights.

With Varjo, designers can work with their colleagues in the physical design space they’re used to and collaborate on photorealistic, real-scale virtual car models while seeing their hands and bodies. In an immersive mixed reality experience like this, they’re able to talk as they go, give immediate feedback, and run more engaging reviews.

“Immersive collaboration works way more naturally than we expected. This is something I’ve always wished for and with the Varjo device, it’s now a reality,” adds Gregory Guillaume, Vice President of Design at Kia Motors Europe.

At the end of a mixed reality session, Unterluggauer takes off the Varjo headset and looks back into the room. “It’s fascinating how quickly you adapt to the mixed reality. You’re tricked into thinking for a moment that reality is wrong, that there is something missing. It’s completely different to any other experience I’ve ever had in VR,” he says. And there’s that magic again.

“Varjo’s mixed reality headset is the perfect addition to our working setup.”

 CAS Manager, KIA Design Center Europe

Kia’s workflow changes up a gear with VR/XR

With Varjo, Kia designers can review new virtual car models next to physical ones; or take a physical clay model and overlay parts of it with virtual data. For instance, in interior design, it allows them to overlay digital content onto a physical seating buck.

Located in Frankfurt, Germany, Kia’s Europe Design Center is helping to change perceptions of the Kia brand across the continent as well as worldwide. Its dedicated team of designers create concept cars of the future as well as production models for both Europe and the global market.

The ability to design and collaborate with Varjo’s photorealistic VR/XR and Autodesk VRED is a total game-changer for Kia’s designers.

Until recently, the automotive design process relied a lot on 2D reviews on screens and powerwalls, followed by physical clay models and prototypes to further refine and develop the surfaces.

As manager of the studio’s digital department, Frank Hübbe knows all too well that a 2D model is always a projection that lacks volume. “Although you can use keyboard, mouse, and screen to work efficiently in 2D, you’ll never get a fully realistic impression of the car,” he says. Today, Kia Europe’s designers are complementing their entire workflow with virtual and mixed reality. The teams are using VR/XR technologies to make their visualization work more effective and showcase projects in new ways.

For example, designers are able to review a virtual model directly against a physical model in the same room, or even augment an existing clay model with virtual details.

“With VRED and Varjo, you have the context of the real world and the flexibility of the virtual world,” Hübbe says.

“Before, reviewing a car model with design management meant flying to Korea and took at least four days. Now, I can do it in one hour.”

Remote collaboration when the world needs it most

The integration of Varjo and the Autodesk VRED software packs a powerful punch for Kia. But in the midst of a global pandemic, the ability to collaborate remotely and reliably with teams across the globe has never been more crucial.

Guillaume and his team can be in the same virtual room with the design management team and look at and discuss the same car model in perfect detail. “That’s only possible if we trust what we’re seeing and the tools we’re using. It amazes me that something so complicated is working so naturally and easily,” he says.

With COVID-19 currently preventing most business travel, Kia Europe has turned to Varjo’s VR/XR and Autodesk VRED’s virtual collaboration feature to continue working with the other global studios. Designers can collaborate on the same photorealistic models from wherever they’re based around the world, trusting that everything from the smallest details to the full-scale appearance of the car looks correct.

As Gregory Guillaume says, until now, if he wanted to discuss a model with the design management at Kia’s global headquarters; he’d have to fly to Korea to do it. Reviewing a digital model with design management always took a minimum of four days. “Now, I can do it in one hour,” he says. The ability to carry out design reviews virtually presents Kia with the opportunity to save vast amounts of time, work and money.

And while professionals worldwide are currently struggling with often unreliable phone and video conferencing technology, Guillaume has had promising experiences with this new collaboration technology. Despite the complexity of the VR/XR hardware and visual rendering software, his team hasn’t had any reliability issues with Varjo and Autodesk VRED at all.

“You’d think this is so much more complicated than a video call. But collaboration has been very reliable,” he says. Guillaume and his team can be in the same virtual room with the design management team and look at and discuss the same car model in perfect detail. “That’s only possible if we trust what we’re seeing and the tools we’re using. It amazes me that something so complicated is working so naturally and easily.”

Despite all the restrictions and uncertainties that come with the global pandemic, using Varjo and Autodesk VRED is enabling KIA to continue their design collaboration with studios across the globe. “This technology is bringing us together at a time when we can’t be present in the same physical place,” Guillaume says.

And no matter how uncertain these times might feel, one thing is certain. Together, Kia, Autodesk VRED and Varjo will continue to drive collaborative automotive design forward.

Fasten your seatbelts – it’s going to be an exciting ride.

“Varjo is a breakthrough for our design workflow. No one else has achieved this level of immersion before.”

 Creative Manager CGI, KIA Design Center Europe

Varjo is the first mixed reality device supported by Autodesk VRED

Varjo is the first mixed reality device supported by Autodesk VRED, the world’s most advanced automotive visualization software. “It’s the perfect fit between two technologies,” says Lukas Fäth, Product Manager for Autodesk VRED.

With Varjo and VRED, automotive designers can collaborate more efficiently than ever – but there’s another big benefit to bringing virtual 3D tools into the design review process.

“With VRED’s highest accuracy in design quality and the photorealism of Varjo, designers can spot problems and make iterations sooner than ever before,” Fäth says.

Born from the innovative solutions of former pilots, the company has developed groundbreaking techniques now utilized by numerous rescue organizations worldwide.

Air Zermatt not only excels in their core mission of saving lives, but also actively imparts their experience and knowledge to the next generation of pilots with their Air Zermatt Training Center. Offering high-level courses that prepare professionals and amateurs for demanding rescues under extreme conditions, the center boasts around 20 expert instructors who train approximately 1,000 course participants from around the world each year.

To maintain safety in the skies, it is crucial for pilots to receive high-quality training all throughout the year with training systems that are both accessible and readily available to accommodate the needs of all trainees. Training in a real aircraft, while valuable for providing hands-on experience, comes with certain limitations. Limited availability of aircraft and instructors can restrict the number of pilots being trained and the frequency of their training sessions. Additionally, unfavorable weather conditions, such as low visibility and strong winds, can hinder or delay training, making it crucial to have alternative training methods during such periods.

In the past, large dome simulators were employed by training providers to tackle some of these limitations, but the visual quality has not quite reached the level of realism required for effective training. “Everything below 30 knots was unrealistic, which made it difficult to train for situations that required lower speeds,” says Gerold Biner, CEO and Pilot at Air Zermatt. Addressing the challenge, Air Zermatt partnered with Loft Dynamics to employ their state-of-the-art H125 VR Training Device utilizing the Varjo Aero headset, with the aim to deliver a game-changing solution to helicopter flight simulation.

A Leap Forward in Helicopter Flight Training

In spring of 2022, Air Zermatt opened their simulator training center at the heliport in Zermatt featuring a VR-based professional training device for the Airbus H125, qualified by the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) and employed by Air Zermatt for comprehensive pilot training and assessment. This cutting-edge simulator featuring the Varjo Aero is developed and produced by Loft Dynamics, a leading manufacturer of virtual reality helicopter training devices.

Training in an immersive environment not only helps to avoid negative training but also presents a cost-effective alternative to training in a real aircraft, completely replacing outdated Full Flight Simulator technologies. The VR-based simulator is 10 times smaller and roughly 20 times less expensive than traditional full-motion simulators. What’s more, it cuts air time training in a real aircraft by up to 60%.

“We were amazed by the performance of the simulator. The advantages of VR headsets are simply game-changing.

With the headset, everything is more realistic and even the simulation below 30 knots is really close to reality, which is absolutely perfect for good training.”

– GEROLD BINER, CEO AND PILOT, AIR ZERMATT

Immersive technology provides a more realistic training experience, particularly for helicopter flights operating close to the ground and below 30 knots. The solution’s advanced features, including true-to-life haptics and visuals, allow pilots to simulate malfunctions and train for challenging emergency scenarios in a safe but realistic setting. “This technology allows pilots to do all the exercises related to Operator Proficiency Checks and License Proficiency Checks below 30 knots, which usually is a big safety issue,” Biner explains. “This device prevents any damage to the aircraft or pilot and provides a huge gain in safety.”

According to Biner, pilots were initially skeptical about the new technology, but quickly realized its benefits. Several pilots from all over the world, including those experienced in emergency procedures, have expressed positive feedback regarding the training. “They now want to come in every six months to use it because they can do much more inside the simulator than outside on a real helicopter,” says Biner. “They are happy that they had this training and emphasized its high training value.”

Pioneering EASA-qualified VR Simulators

Loft Dynamics, the pioneer behind the virtual reality-based training solution employed by Air Zermatt, is the first company to have their helicopter training solution officially qualified by EASA. This qualification is essential for pilots to receive credit for their training done with the simulator. Combined with Varjo’s highest-resolution headsets, Loft Dynamics’ simulators were able to successfully meet the hundreds of requirements to obtain the EASA qualification. The EASA-qualification marks a pivotal milestone for the entire VR/XR industry, proving that immersive simulations can bring tangible benefits to pilot training.

The advantages are clear: The VR-based simulator enables pilots to efficiently and cost-effectively complete their annual proficiency checks, directly at or close to their homebase, which usually saves 2-3 working days compared to a check in a dome-based Full Flight Simulator at a training center. With EASA-qualified virtual reality simulators, pilots can not only receive credit for their virtual training time but also benefit from the high training value and flexibility of the immersive solution. This aligns seamlessly with Air Zermatt’s mission.

“Our goal is to share our experiences and bring more safety to this industry. The combination of the Varjo headset, the avatar design, and the cockpit with all the switches makes it the best simulator I’ve ever flown,” says Biner.

Motion sickness in VR

Motion sickness, also known as simulator sickness or cyber sickness, commonly occurs when using virtual reality and mixed reality technologies (VR / XR) if the quality of the experience is not high enough. The symptoms of motion sickness include nausea, disorientation, discomfort, eye strain, and drowsiness.

Motion sickness in VR does not require actual movement to occur: the perceived motion in the VR simulation is enough to trigger it.

There are several theorized causes for simulator sickness, and even the sensitivity to each cause can vary between people.

Practical sources of motion sickness in MR, AR, and VR

High latency. If the VR experience of the headset being used for training has high latency, it can cause simulator sickness.
Latency in video pass-through: When operating in mixed reality where digital and real-world objects are mixed together, the video pass-through must have sufficiently low latency to avoid simulator sickness
Low refresh rate: If the headset has a low refresh rate, this can cause simulator sickness.
Incorrect interpupillary distance (IPD). The distance between each person’s eyes varies a lot. This means that headsets, which use lenses to display the image, must also have a way to change the position of those lenses to account for the different interpupillary distances. Recent studies have shown that an improperly adjusted interpupillary distance (IPD) is the cause of 40% of all cyber sickness.
Laggy or inaccurate hand tracking: Slow and inaccurate hand tracking can also in motion sickness as some users experience discomfort when they move their hand but it doesn’t follow fast enough in their visual perception compared to the sense of their limb.
Low resolution. When low resolution scenes are displayed close to the eye , it can cause eye strain and motion sickness. Low resolution also makes it hard for the wearer to use their gaze as they would in real life, because they are unable to see objects that are far away in meaningful detail (which they could do in real life).

How to tackle motion sickness in VR?

Professional-grade headsets, such as Varjo XR-3 and VR-3, have made massive strides in eliminating motion sickness. Varjo’s headsets can be used for hours on end without motion sickness experienced by the user.

Capabilities that ensure a comfortable experience without motion sickness include:

Automatic interpupillary-distance adjustment. Varjo headsets automatically calibrate themselves to each individual user so their IPD is taken into account to avoid cyber sickness. With an IPD range of 57–73mm, they fit almost any potential user.
High refresh rate: Varjo headsets have a refresh rate of 90 hz, which helps avoid simulator sickness.
Extremely high resolution: With resolutions of more than 70 pixels per degree, which is greater than what can be detected by a human eye with 20/20 vision, Varjo headsets can display virtual scenes in real-life fidelity and allow users to perceive objects at realistic visibility distances.
Low latency, high-definition video pass-through: Varjo XR-3 is capable of true mixed reality where video and virtual representations reach parity and cannot be differentiated. The core technology that provides mixed reality is video pass-through, enabled by stereo 12-megapixel cameras that digitize the world in real-time. With latency under 20 milliseconds, this delay is undetectable in normal interaction situations and universally deemed good enough to avoid the creation of false sensations and simulator sickness.

Varjo customer testimonial on motion sickness being eliminated:

“During my trials, I have noticed dramatically reduced VR motion sickness with the Varjo VR-3 headset, this includes those that experience motion sickness with other VR headsets. We experienced around 10 cases of VR sickness out of c. 1000 people in trials and demonstrations when using the Varjo VR-3, which is a substantial decrease when compared to other VR headsets that we have trialed. 

The Varjo VR-3 is a remarkable VR headset that can enable effective future synthetic training solutions for defense by enabling users to read the smallest text, experiencing the highest levels of photorealism and experience significantly reduced VR motion sickness when compared to other VR headsets on the market. 

The Varjo VR-3 is the headset that I currently recommend for use within the VR training pipeline primarily because of the decreased levels of motion sickness and ability to read small text which is imperative within any vehicle simulator.”

Reimagining Aeromedical Training: How Real Response is Transforming the Way We Learn with Mixed Reality

Australian simulation training provider Real Response is leveraging Varjo’s mixed reality to solve aeromedical teams’ greatest training challenge: access to live airframes.

Disrupting the Industry With New Effective Tools

Key benefits of XR for Aeromedical training:

Allowing learning in environments which are often expensive to access, use, and maintain
Eliminating logistical issues with accessing real aircraft for training, including aircraft and pilot availability and maintenance
Removing the limitations of time and place and reducing issues associated with trainee/trainer availability and location
Flexibility: the system can be used to address a range of training issues beyond aeromedical for Army, Navy, Air Force and Marine Corp applications

Founded in 2014, Australian training company Real Response provides simulation-based training for over 30,000 students annually across Australia and the globe. They specialise in medical, trauma and safety training for both defence and civilian sectors, with the aim of empowering people with vital skills to navigate critical situations.

Real Response initially started by disrupting traditional CPR and First Aid training through live simulation and the use of props such as fake blood, smoke, and sound effects. As they continued to grow, the company expanded their training offerings to include fire training, mental health first aid training, tactical medicine, and advanced medical training, all following their methodology of simulation and immersive learning.

Real Response’s philosophy is to focus on providing the best outcome for the user and the student, using whatever is the most effective tool. When considering medical training, which requires a high level of dexterity and fine motor skills, they turned to Varjo’s mixed reality to provide a highly immersive and accessible training experience with the goal of filling a gap in the market.

Challenge: Limitations in Providing Cost-Effective and Scalable Training

Real Response, a company made up of clinicians and educators with medical backgrounds, encountered the difficulties of accessing airframes for both defence and civilian aeromedical training. Limitations in cost, availability of crew and aircraft, weather conditions, maintenance, and high operating costs led the team to find a technological solution for this problem.

They turned their focus to immersive technologies and drew inspiration from Professor Bob Stone’s work on his mixed reality Medical Emergency Response Team training simulator at the University of Birmingham and with the UK Ministry of Defence.

Real Response released their first virtual reality application in 2018, followed by the launch of an XR department in 2020, allowing them to develop advanced, cost-effective virtual, augmented, desktop, and mixed reality solutions with Varjo’s headsets.

The Solution: Fully Immersive Mixed Reality Platform for Medical Training

Their BlueRoom™ simulation platform, developed with the support of the Australian Defence Innovation Hub, enables students to train for complex medical scenarios in a mixed reality environment.

Varjo’s Focal Edition headset allows trainees to interact with real-world objects and develop their fine motor skills effectively. “Varjo’s headset was the only one on the market capable of doing what we needed,” says , Founder and Director of Future Projects at Real Response. “High resolution visuals are crucial in our simulations, and with the Focal Edition, the level of definition is beyond comparison. We are able to read the fine-print on a 1ml drug ampule and to visualise the epiglottis as we perform an airway intubation.”

The BlueRoom™ simulation platform features a mission control system that allows the instructor to change the scenario in real-time, creating infinite possibilities. This gives the instructor full control over the training environment, allowing them to facilitate and adjust all aspects of the simulation, such as manipulating the patient’s blood pressure based on the student’s actions.

Real Response is also working with Garmin to integrate biometrics into mixed reality, enabling them to analyse student stress levels during simulations and optimise scenarios for better learning outcomes. They are also working on an AI engine that can interpret the baseline stress level of the user and make recommendations to the instructor.

Concrete Benefits from Filling a Much-Needed Gap

Real Response provides live simulation training to over 30,000 students each year using traditional methods. However, mixed reality provides a unique benefit when live simulation or real-world experience cannot be achieved. It allows learning in environments which are often expensive to access, use, and maintain, and reduces issues associated with trainee/trainer availability.

The use of Varjo headsets has enabled Real Response to provide training in environments that may not be accessible in the real world, allowing for more comprehensive and diverse training scenarios such as training for emergency medical procedures in space.

“The high-quality products and assistance that Varjo provides really meet both our, and our clients’ needs, and it’s great to have a strong partnership with such a dependable company.”

Benjamin Krynski
 -
 Founder and Director of Future Projects at Real Response

Strong Partnership for Pioneering the Future of Simulated Training 

Real Response is dedicated to creating impactful and life-saving learning experiences. To achieve this goal, they seek trustworthy partnerships with reliable companies. Benjamin Krynski praises Varjo for their support.  “The high-quality products and assistance that Varjo provides really meet both our, and our clients’ needs, and it’s great to have a strong partnership with such a dependable company.”

Real Response’s use of Varjo’s Focal Edition headsets in medical training has left a lasting impression on their clients and partners. The high-definition visuals and hand tracking capabilities have amazed many who have never seen the technology before.

Real Response is committed to staying ahead of the curve in their field, with a vision of a future where training and simulation experiences resemble the level of futurism depicted in science fiction. Krynski is excited about the future of their relationship with Varjo.  “I am excited to continue exploring the possibilities of mixed reality technology to improve medical training. The possibilities are endless, and I’m eager to see where this technology will take us.”

Tracking is calibrated when you set up Varjo inside-out tracking and a new calibration is started automatically whenever you use the headset in a new environment. The headset can remember where it was last used and no calibration is needed in the same environment.

You can manually start a new calibration at any time as follows:

XR-4

Navigate to the System tab in Varjo Base.
Under Tracking select Recalibrate floor level.

XR-3

Navigate to the System tab in Varjo Base.
Under Headset tracking, make sure that Varjo inside-out tracking (Beta) is selected.

Mixed Reality

Mixed reality (MR/XR) combines the best aspects of both VR and AR. It is all about merging virtual content with the real world in an interactive, immersive way. In mixed reality, virtual objects appear as a natural part of the real world, occluding behind real objects. Real objects can also influence the shadows and lights of virtual contents. This natural interaction between real and virtual opens a whole new realm of solutions that would not be possible with virtual or augmented reality.

Mixed reality gives you the ability to see yourself and interact with your colleagues while, for example, designing a virtual object or environment. For XR to be valuable for professionals, it must be convincing – blending real and virtual content to the point that it’s impossible to tell where reality ends, and the virtual world begins. XR is best accomplished with video pass-through technology instead of optical see-through projections.

With video pass-through-based solutions, virtual objects can be black or opaque and appear as solid as anything in the real world. Colors are perfectly rendered, appear just as they should, and you can also add, omit, and adjust colors, shadows, and light in the virtual world and the real world.

All of this means that you need powerful computer hardware to run these experiences. However, recent advancements in technology have made it achievable with high-end consumer desktops. That way, any business now has the capacity to adopt mixed reality solutions, and the business impact can be astounding.

Leading the advancement of professional XR and VR

Investment into immersive technologies (VR, AR, and XR) is growing over 50% year-over-year so the time to start is now! Every day, Varjo devices are used to speed up design workflows, cut prototyping costs, improve training efficacy and efficiency, gain deeper insights into human research, and much more – all in a photorealistic immersive environment.

Mixed Reality is a combination of the best of both virtual and augmented reality. XR enables seamless mixing of virtual and real elements and objects in a way never seen before. Varjo’s video pass-through technology is vastly superior to the standard optical see-through systems used in other augmented reality headsets – making Varjo XR-3 the only device where virtual objects look real instead of appearing as holographic augmentations.

Ready to see your own virtual content in human-eye resolution? Looking to virtualize your workflows and operations? Working to improve force safety and readiness? Discover why your peers and competitors are already leveraging Varjo’s professional XR and VR technologies today.

Compared to 2D screens, Varjo’s mixed and virtual reality solutions improve student engagement and learning outcomes through immersive environments and true-to-life visualizations of complex topics.

Learn why leading universities worldwide choose Varjo’s solutions in XR and VR for education and to engage with their students and power their research.

Benefits across all the faculties.

And with comfort factors such as active cooling and zero cybersickness, you can host longer training sessions without having to worry about adverse reactions.

With Varjo’s solutions, you’ll be able to teach technical subjects such as engineering and design, visualize complex topics such as human anatomy, practice core skills such as surgery or operating dangerous machinery, simulate critical scenarios such as emergency response, or conduct student research or studies in a scalable and repeatable way.

Varjo XR-4 Secure Edition – TAA certified mixed reality for secure environments.

The XR-4 Secure Edition is the world’s most advanced mixed reality headset for simulation, allowing real-world and virtual elements to be blended together seamlessly for highly effective and cost-efficient training scenarios. Assembled in state-of-the-art facilities in Finland, it is both certified and optimized for secure environments.

Ultimate security and precision in mixed reality.

Meet Varjo XR-4 Secure Edition.

Industry-leading visual fidelity with 4K by 4K, 200 nits mini-LED displays and a 96% DCI-P3 color space.
Revolutionary full-dome optics span flawless aspheric clarity across a massive 120° x 105° field of view.
True human vision replicated in XR by dual 20-megapixel cameras powering up to 51 PPD passthrough and the world’s first gaze-driven XR autofocus system.
Assembled in Finland supporting full TAA compliancy and has no online connectivity requirements.
Advanced sensor fusion combining 300 Kpix extended range LiDAR, 200 Hz eye tracking, and all-new ambient light reconstruction cameras.
Inside-out tracking is integrated as standard and options for alternate tracking methods are available.
Designed for interactive training with integrated speakers that support DTS 3D spatial audio and dual noise-cancelling microphones.
Premium support included offering priority response times, onboarding, and shipping.

Experience a no-compromise approach to immersion for training and simulation. Crystal-clear 4K per eye mini-LED displays deliver the accuracy and visual fidelity required for true one-to-one recreations of training environments.

A new ultra-wide 120° x 105° field of view delivers full binocular range vision, and 200 nits of brightness and 1:10000 contrast ratio achieved with local dimming serves both day and night training scenarios.

Varjo’s signature XR cameras facilitate mixed reality simulation setups where real-world elements such as cockpits, maps or tools can be seamlessly merged with virtual content.

The XR-4 Secure Edition’s 20-megapixel cameras deliver industry-leading clarity in passthrough, allowing even small text and avionics to be easily read.

The XR-4 Secure Edition with autofocus further enhances the mixed reality experience, driving an unprecedented 51 PPD in passthrough and introduces the world’s first XR gaze-driven autofocus camera system.

Training and simulation software ready.

The XR-4 Secure Edition is designed to provide unrestricted performance at high frame rates for graphically intense and computationally complex simulations.

Tap into full compatibility with high-end training software such as Bohemia’s VBS Blue IG, PREPAR3D, and many others.

“We are breaking the boundary between what’s real and virtual.”

–Sébastien Lozé, Business Director of Simulations, Epic Games

”The Varjo XR-4 Series doesn’t just elevate the simulator experience—it transforms it entirely.”

–Javier Castellar, Co-founder and Chief Strategy Officer of Aechelon

“Unlock a next-level experience for astronauts in terms of training and mission preparation.”

– Felix Gorbatsevich, CEO of PaleBlue

”Varjo’s new XR-4 Series has the highest resolution displays which aligns perfectly with our I/ITSEC theme of ‘replicating reality in a digital world’.”

– George Forbes, founder and CEO of Immersive Display Systems, Inc.

”The XR-4 Series raises the realism of immersive training to a whole new level.”

– Oli Arup, Chief Product Officer of Bohemia Interactive Simulations

Highest-level security and support.

Unlike other headsets in the XR-4 Series, all XR-4 Secure Edition units are assembled in a state-of-the-art facility in Finland, ensuring full TAA compliancy.

Each headset runs completely offline and can be configured to have no radio components, ensuring they are suitable for exceptionally high-security situations and closed-loop network environments.

The XR-4 Secure Edition comes with access to world-class support with less than one business day support guarantees, guided onboarding sessions, priority shipping, and more.

Inside-out tracking is integrated as standard, allowing full 6DoF positional tracking without the need for base stations. For setups where SteamVR™ tracking is required, a version with added support is available for purchase. Tracking with ART and OptiTrack is also supported via API.

Hand tracking support can also be added for hand based interactions and gesture recognition, with the optional Ultraleap hand tracking kit.

Choose your mixed reality experience.

The Varjo XR-4 Secure Edition consists of two variants. For use cases where virtual content is the focus of the experience, the fixed focus version provides best-in-class visual fidelity. For scenarios where real-world elements need to be seen in perfect detail, such as simulators with detailed physical cockpits, the autofocus version adds enhanced passthrough to the mix.

Note about laptop graphics cards

Laptop graphics cards with identical names can perform differently depending on factors such as the thermal design of the laptop and amount of memory on the card.

Some key terms to keep in mind when comparing graphics cards:

Total Graphics Power (TGP): The maximum power consumption of a graphics card, which gives an indication of its maximum performance.
GPU memory: Graphics cards come in many variants with different amounts of memory on the card, which also affects performance.

Visual precision in mixed reality close up.

Seeing crucial dials and knobs in proper focus with content close to the user requires a closer focusing point.

The mixed reality camera system in the Varjo XR-3 Focal Edition is calibrated to provide improved image clarity in the 30 cm to 80 cm range (12” to 31”) from the headset, in comparison to a standard XR-3.

Highest-level security and privacy.

The XR-3 Focal Edition is built with the most demanding security environments in mind, across defense, intelligence, and critical infrastructure.

The headset is sold with a perpetual, offline license that enables operations in non-internet connected environments and does not require users to create accounts.

Furthermore, it can be delivered with radio frequency capability removed as required to operate in some classified environments.

Specialized compliance needs covered.

The XR-3 Focal Edition is fully TAA-compliant (the Trade Agreements Act), with the devices being built at Varjo’s HQ in Helsinki, Finland.

TAA compliance is becoming an ever-increasing requirement enabling HMD-based solutions to be used for secure and classified operations.

All the industry-leading features of the standard model.

Offering photorealistic, true-to-life mixed reality combined with industry-leading capabilities and components found in a headset, the Varjo XR-3 Focal Edition includes everything available in the standard Varjo XR-3.

It is also compatible with all the same software applications and hardware devices—no extra customization is required.

“The Varjo XR-3 Focal Edition offers the required visual fidelity for advanced training simulations where operating physical instruments within mixed reality is mission-critical.”

 -
 General in Reserve & Former Chief of Defence, Finnish Defence Forces

“In mixed reality pilot training, having the visual precision to operate avionics is paramount. Lockheed Martin's simulators integrate with the Varjo XR-3 Focal Edition’s passthrough cameras for viewing the physical controls and dashboards in a cockpit.”

Adam Breed, Strategic Technologies Architect, Lockheed Martin Training and Logistics Solutions

“With this advanced mixed reality solution, pilots can also use physical controllers that are needed to operate commercial aircraft, strongly enhancing our training outcomes.”

Daniel Jäger, TKI, Lufthansa Aviation Training Switzerland AG

“Our engineering team has noticed a clear difference in the ability to read instruments on the avionics panel thanks to Varjo’s all new XR-3 Focal Edition.”

Chad Schmitz, Product Manager for Mixed Reality Flight, FlightSafety International

“With the XR-3 Focal Edition, we’re able to deliver world-class mixed-reality, multi-sensor and visual solutions for a variety of advanced customers for the US Air Force, US Navy, US Marines, US Coast Guard, and Allied Partner nations on the most stringent use cases.”

Javier Castellar, CSO and Co-Founder, Aechelon Technology Inc.

“The Varjo XR-3 Focal Edition perfectly addresses our customer’s requirements for training in Mixed Reality.”

George Forbes, CEO, IDSI

“The XR-3 Focal Edition provides the clarity to check if the wings of an aircraft miles away are level while also clearly and vibrantly showing something that is millimeters in size in the operations center.”

Dan Meeks, Simulation Consultant, Battlespace Simulations

“We’re seeing a radical improvement when reading print and digital text in a mixed reality cockpit training scenario with the Varjo XR-3 Focal Edition.”

Bert Haselden, Mixed Reality Lead Engineer, MVRsimulation

The world’s first mixed reality test drive

Together, Volvo Cars and Varjo are literally driving the future by creating the world’s first mixed reality approach to evaluating prototypes, designs and active safety technologies.

For the first time ever, Volvo Cars and Varjo have made it possible to drive a real car while wearing a mixed reality headset, seamlessly adding virtual elements that seem real.

Case Volvo – Results:

Perform design-studies of future cars before they are built
Avoid tool and software changes, saving a significant amount of money along the way

Iterate design and UX concepts quickly, testing them in real-life scenarios – literally take your designs for a virtual reality test drive
Do things in a day that would normally take weeks or longer

Volvo Cars has been using Varjo's mixed reality prototypes in their workflow since the summer of 2018. By adding photorealistic virtual elements to the interior of the car, Volvo Cars designers are able to perform design-studies of future cars before they are even built. 

Unmodified material shot through a Varjo mixed reality headset.

The use of Varjo’s mixed reality enables Volvo Cars to iterate design and UX concepts quickly and to avoid tedious tool and software changes, saving a significant amount of money along the way. “We’ll be able to do things in a day that would normally take weeks or longer,” Casper Wickman says.

When it comes to the design evaluation process, it’s crucial to be able to see the outer shape and proportions of the car, but also the fit and finish between the components, the graining of the leather, and more. 

“Varjo adds unprecedented realism, which means we have more faith in the results of our evaluations. And it’s so much faster as there’s no limit to what we can do in mixed reality,” Wickman says.

Test-driving real cars – on real roads

Volvo Cars engineers have been test-driving a real Volvo XC90 car with the driver wearing a Varjo mixed reality headset. Previously this has not been possible with any other device.

“When you’re using XR to drive, latency is as important or more important than resolution. Varjo manages to be extraordinary at both.”

“Varjo is the only device where you can no longer tell what’s real and what’s not.”

Varjo enables Volvo Cars to perform unique user research

With Varjo’s integrated eye tracking, Volvo can understand the relevance and results of user analyses. Eye tracking adds a very big layer of capability and trustworthiness – you’re observing the vehicle as the customer would, so you get a much more efficient view of what’s important and what’s not.

With Varjo, Volvo is able to perform UX studies by keeping as much as possible of reality – the real road, nature, road signs and more – and only exchange the things they want to evaluate, for example a new display or interior, during the virtual and mixed reality test drive.

“When you’re driving with Varjo’s mixed reality device, you actually forget you’re looking through a headset. People using Varjo break when they see a virtual moose crossing the road. Or when a virtual car overtakes our test car, test drivers have asked “Is that car real or not?”.

 As for the future, Wickman says there are endless opportunities to extend the collaboration to manufacturing, car assembly training, retail, car configuration, research and more. “From now on, each time we want to try something that doesn’t exist, Varjo will be the technology we will use.”

Hand Tracking

Hand tracking is a technology that helps you operate in a VR or MR environment and interact with it without separate controllers. Instead, your hands turn into a virtual version of themselves, and you can naturally use them to control the virtual environment – just as you would interact with a real-world environment.

Hand tracking enables anyone to engage with virtual or mixed reality contents immediately and intuitively – even if they have no experience with VR or gaming. Users can interact with and move components around just by using their hands. In augmented and mixed reality, users can switch fluidly between interacting with real and virtual objects. Users can do gestures such as pinching, grabbing, or pointing to interact with virtual content. Real-world hand movements and gestures can also be mirrored by virtual avatars, allowing for a new level of immersion in your VR/XR applications and collaborations.

Hand tracking is not built into Varjo XR-4 Series headsets. Instead, all Varjo XR-4 Series (except for Secure Edition) devices come with in-box Varjo Controllers, powered by Razer, to enable high-precision interactions with virtual contents as well as high tactile immersion. Controllers are also available for purchase for all customers.

Varjo XR-3 and VR-3 headsets come with integrated Ultraleap handtracking technology. Varjo Aero does not feature built-in hand tracking.

Eye Tracker in VR

Eye tracking in VR (or gaze tracking) is a technology for measuring the gaze direction of a user. When combined with positional head tracking, one can determine the exact point the user is looking at in the real or virtual world. Apart from detecting the point of interest, the system provides information about fixations (whether a user is focusing on something), saccades, and other eye motion patterns such as blinking and pupil dilation. This technology can have enormous benefits for researchers or application developers, as they can study human behavior in virtual environments or create interactions solely based on the user’s gaze.

Eye tracking is already widely utilized in many fields of research, including marketing, psychology, medicine, usability, and user behavior. It also has many important use cases in VR/AR and is rapidly becoming a standard feature in high-end headsets. Examples include automatic inter-pupillary distance (IPD) adjustment, detecting when a headset is worn, and automated user detection through iris recognition. It can also be used as a control mechanism in user interfaces, and to improve the realism of social avatars.

Varjo XR-4 Series headsets all have integrated eye tracking functions with 1-degree accuracy.

Just like for any other display device, the resolution of a VR headset refers to the number of pixels that can be displayed at one time. As an example, the Varjo XR-4 offers a resolution of 3840 x 3744 pixels per eye. Resolution is best measured as pixels per degree (or PPD) in a user’s field of view.

Varjo XR-4’s resolution of 51 pixels per degree delivers over 50% wider field of view (120° x 105°) compared to previous-generation devices, with double the display brightness (200 nits) and a wider color gamut with 96% DCI-P3.

Varjo Aero features the highest resolution of any consumer device today (over 35 PPD), allowing users to see and experience VR environments in a crystal-clear way. With dual mini-LED displays, crystal-clear aspheric lenses, and a 115° field of view for stunning edge-to-edge clarity, the device offers a massive step up in visual fidelity over consumer-grade virtual reality headsets.

Mixed Reality in JTAC Training: A New Dimension in Defence Preparedness

Reflecting a trend seen in other defence sectors, such as pilot training, headset-based mixed reality simulation is emerging as a new tool to complement traditional training solutions.

The role of a Joint Terminal Attack Controller (JTAC) is critical in the realm of military operations. These qualified service members are entrusted with coordinating the action of combat aircraft during close air support and other air operations.

The training for JTACs is rigorous, incorporating hands-on practice designed to prepare them for the complexities of their role. Reflecting a trend seen in other defence sectors, such as pilot training, headset-based mixed reality simulation is emerging as a new tool to complement traditional training solutions. There are many benefits to adopting a mixed reality training simulator in the JTAC training curriculum. It brings training to the point of need, integrating essential external tools and providing a cost-effective and streamlined solution that doesn’t compromise on quality. In a mixed reality training environment, real and virtual elements can be seamlessly blended together, enabling trainees to navigate the scenario freely by just putting on the headset.

Transporting JTAC Trainees Across the Globe in a Virtual Environment

Within a JTAC training scenario, users are looking to be transported into realistic observation points, which could range from mountain tops overlooking battlefields to dense urban settings. In a mixed reality simulation, the JTAC trainee can be placed in any part of the world, allowing trainees to feel as though they are physically present in the training environment. When they put on the headset, they’re able to experience being in that location while also having access to their tools, such as notebooks, radios, and software that they use to do their job. Having the added availability of external tool integration is essential for effective JTAC training and allows for a seamless integration that maintains a natural flow of operations.

Mixed reality JTAC training also introduces a significant advantage in terms of portability. With a lightweight setup, providers can take XR simulation to the point of need where training takes place to support some of the more traditional training systems in use. This flexibility allows for more frequent deployments of training, offering an efficient alternative to the space and cost constraints sometimes posed by traditional physical simulators, such as large dome solutions.

“If you want the best of both worlds: mixed reality external tool integration and cost effectiveness, this is the answer,” says , Mission Systems Operator & TACP JTAC.

Realism Redefined for the Securest of Environments

Within a virtual JTAC training environment, high-resolution and the ability to see fine details are important in order for users to interact with equipment and reference materials during simulations.

“The significance of the Varjo XR-4 is that the resolution of the pass-through cameras gives enough detail that users can read their watch, notebook, maps, radios – all these devices that they are working with,” says Andrew W. Jamison, General Manager at Immersive Display Solutions. “It’s essential that we are able to have enough resolution to be able to resolve and read those things through the cameras.”

“Additionally. the Varjo XR-4 Secure Edition with its TAA compliance is absolutely required for us since most of our customers need to use these in secure environments, and having that offline configuration is a requirement for our customers.”

In JTAC training, trainees are often scanning the horizon looking for aircrafts, looking out over their shoulders, or looking through their peripheral vision, making is crucial for simulations to be equipped with a realistic field of view. “A wider field of view, such as you find in the XR-4, really improves immersion, and once you’re immersed, training improves,” says Oliver Arup, Chief Product Officer at Bohemia Interactive Simulations.

“I think this is a game changer for the industry. I think that mixed reality eventually is going to be the standard utilized for JTAC sims.”

Setting New Standards in JTAC Training

The adoption of mixed reality in JTAC training is gaining momentum within the industry, one indication of this shift being the MVRsimulation JTAC simulator receiving full accreditation from the Joint Fire Support Executive Steering Committee. It means that the training done in the mixed reality scenario is recognized as official training towards JTAC certification, marking a significant advancement in how military training is conducted.

“It’s really exciting for us to be the first in the industry for a JTAC mixed reality simulator to receive full accreditation,” says W. Garth Smith, President at MVRSimulation.

“The simulator has been judged to be so accurate and realistic that those controls that would normally have to be done in real world can now be done in simulation. It’s a big breakthrough for the industry.”

Extended Reality

Extended reality (XR) is an umbrella term that refers to all experiences combining reality and augmented or virtual content. The term encompasses virtual reality, augmented reality, and mixed reality. VR, AR, and MR can be thought of as sub-categories of extended reality technologies.

For Varjo, XR refers to our headsets’ ability to deliver anything between the real reality and virtual reality to the user, thanks to the flexibility of the video pass-through technology.

True Extended Reality devices (XR), such as Varjo, allow you to choose your level of virtuality freely in the experiences you decide to create. You can jump from 100 % real to a fully synthetic environment and back – or anywhere in between. Every pixel that the user sees can be controlled and manipulated, allowing for a seamless immersion.

Varjo is a first-of-a-kind headset to offer the ability to seamlessly switch from Real Reality into Mixed Reality onwards into full VR, and back to Real Reality. This makes for a very impressive demo. It is a Matrix-like moment to see the surrounding reality disappear and replaced by a virtual scene – and then traveling back. This is something that no other device is able to do.

Navigate to the System tab in Varjo Base.
Under Headset tracking, make sure that Varjo inside-out tracking (Beta) is selected.
Start Varjo inside-out tracking (Beta) calibration.

Read more about preparing your environment.

Forward direction and origin

When using Varjo inside-out tracking, you can quickly adjust the forward direction, origin point, and floor level of your tracking environment. This is useful if, for example, you want an application to start in another direction.

You can adjust the tracking setup as follows:

In Varjo Base, navigate to the System tab and select Forward direction and origin. Alternatively, open the Menu and select the shortcut for Forward direction and origin.
Move to the location you want to set as the origin point of your tracking environment.
Face the direction you want the content to appear from.

Perform this setup whenever you start to use the headset and base stations in a new environment, or if you move the base stations in your current environment.

Read more about preparing your environment.

Override origin and direction

When using SteamVR™ Tracking, you can override the origin point, direction, and floor level of your room setup in Varjo Base. This can help you temporarily fix tracking-related problems, such as your application starting in the wrong direction or virtual content drifting out of place.

The override feature applies to your headset by default. Other trackables, such as controllers, are affected if your application supports the feature.

Note that this feature is intended to be a temporary fix only. We recommend you carefully check your tracking environment and perform a new room setup in SteamVR to correct problems related to tracking.

Follow the instructions to adjust your room setup:

 Place your headset in the location where you want to start the scene and point it in the desired direction.
 In Varjo Base, navigate to the System tab and select Override origin and direction. The Override button text will change to Active.
 If needed, set the headset elevation in centimeters under Headset elevation from floor.

While the override setting is active, your application will use the adjusted room setup over the original one.

Return to your original room setup by clicking the Active button.

Analytics window

The Analytics window in Varjo Base includes tools that are useful for developers in particular.

To open the Analytics window, navigate to Developer tools and select Analytics window. Click the icon in the bottom left corner to bring up the toolbar.

The following features are available in the Analytics window toolbar:

If you encounter a problem with your Varjo product or service that requires help from Varjo Support team, collecting diagnostics can help to solve the issue quickly. Using Varjo Base, you can collect information about your Varjo system and send it to Varjo Support for troubleshooting.

To start diagnostics collection, go to Support tab > Troubleshooting > Diagnostics.

With some Varjo headsets you can choose what diagnostics you want to gather:

Eye camera (XR-4, XR-3, VR-3, and Aero):

Recording of headset’s eye camera for troubleshooting eye tracking related issues.

Varjo inside-out tracking (XR-4, XR-3):

Recording of headset’s front cameras for troubleshooting inside-out tracking related issues.

Recording of controllers for troubleshooting tracking and connection issues.

Additionally, diagnostics information includes for example the following:

Varjo system log files, including system events and error messages.
Computer hardware configuration, including, for example, motherboard, processor, graphics card, memory.
Computer OS and installed software: Windows version, Varjo Base version, SteamVR version (if installed).
Connected headset information: headset serial number, firmware version.
Connected peripherals information: for example, third-party controllers, and trackers.

When sending diagnostics, we ask you to provide an email address (mandatory) and additional notes and attachments (optional) to Varjo for contacting you about your support request.

You can choose to send all or only part of the diagnostic files to Varjo. You can always review and edit all diagnostic files before sending them to Varjo. Varjo Base never sends diagnostics automatically.

You can choose to help our product development and allow sending automatic crash reports to Varjo in case the system malfunctions. This feature can be controlled from Varjo Base.
Crash reports include Varjo system log files, including system events and error messages. Crash reports do not contain your personal data.
Varjo System does not report crashes without your permission.

Software and firmware updates

You can download software and firmware updates for your headset and Varjo Controllers either in Varjo Base or manually from Varjo Account Portal. We recommend that you always use the latest supported software and firmware for your headset.

Note that you will need a Varjo Account to download updates.

Automatic software and firmware updates

To enable automatic software and firmware updates, navigate to the Support tab and enable Automatically check for updates. This allows Varjo Base to automatically check and display a notification when updates are available. Varjo Base will always ask for your permission to install updates.

Manual software and firmware updates

To manually check for software and firmware updates, navigate to the Support tab and select either Varjo Base software update, Headset firmware update, or Controller firmware update (XR-4). If a newer version is available, select Download and follow the instructions to update.

For computers without internet access, you can download the files on another computer, copy the installation file over to your computer, and install.

While a firmware update is running, open View details to follow its progress. The update process may take a while, during which your headset will restart several times. Do not disconnect the headset, quit Varjo Base, or turn off your computer while the update is in progress.

If the firmware update is not successfully completed, we recommend that you run it a second time. If you still encounter a problem, please contact Varjo Support.

Important:  Only use Varjo Base to install firmware updates for your headset and controllers. Never attempt to update the firmware using the SteamVR application. If SteamVR suggests you update the firmware, please ignore the notification.

XR-4 Series Beta Tool

Varjo XR-4 Series Beta Tool provides a set of options and information that will help you to monitor the headset performance and adjust a few parameters for features that are still under development during the Beta phase. Varjo Customer Support may also advise you to use the tool to help diagnose a possible issue with your headset.

 the Beta Tool does not affect the headset’s performance, and it can be kept open while using the headset.

Opening the Beta Tool

Using the Beta Tool

Varjo Inside-out tracking settings
Define presets and restore default settings

Opening the Beta Tool

The tool VarjoXR-4SeriesBetaTool.exe is included in the Varjo Base installation package. The default installation location is C:Program FilesVarjovarjo-betatool .

Using the Beta Tool

When the headset is connected and powered on, the tool displays the initialization process for the headset’s camera streams. The statuses for each stream are:

Running

To ensure reliable restart of the headset, the headset should only be powered on when all processes are in “Idle” state.

In case of problems with restarting the processes, Reboot Cameras button can be used to restart the camera system.

Once the camera systems are up and running, the Beta Tool displays the status of each individual stream with color-coding:

Green color: system is performing as expected
Yellow and Red color: status may occasionally briefly display yellow color, which is not yet an indication of performance issues. However, if any of the streams shows up constantly as yellow or red, some of the features of the headset are not functioning correctly. In this case, it is recommended to check that your computer’s USB port and motherboard chipset are compatible with XR-4. See System requirements for XR-4 for more information.

Ambient light sensor readings can be viewed in the Beta Tool. This information can be useful for finding out an ideal white balance setting to use in Mixed reality camera settings in Varjo Base.

Focus value offset

In XR-4 Focal Edition, focus distances for the left and right eye can be adjusted separately. This setting can be used to mitigate issues in autofocus behavior if:

Video pass-through cameras do not focus correctly onto an object. For example, if an object 50 cm away does not appear sharp on the headset displays.
There is a discrepancy in focus between left and right.

To manually correct focus calibration issues, follow these steps:

Set Automatic mixed reality camera focus distance off and manually set the focus distance to 50 cm from Mixed Reality settings in Varjo Base.
Turn on Real-world view from Varjo Base.
Put the headset on a table and place an object 50 cm away from the headset cameras.
Start XR-4 Beta Tool and adjust the sliders so that the object is sharp in both left and right cameras. You can use the Analytics window to see when the image is sharp.
Set Automatic mixed reality camera focus distance back on from Varjo Base.

Note: If you want to manually adjust focus so that the image is sharp at, for example, exactly 100 cm, use Varjo Base instead. Navigate to Mixed reality settings in Varjo Base, turn the Auto focus to manual mode, and then use a slider to control the focusing distance in centimeters.

Varjo Inside-out tracking settings

The Beta Tool can be used to do small adjustments to the behaviour of Varjo Inside-out tracking.

Switch tracking cameras:You can select either the top or bottom cameras for inside-out tracking:

Click the dropdown menu next to Stream input override.
Select which cameras to use for tracking.
Click Restart Tracking Tasks.

Dampening: In case the tracking quality in your environment is not stable, you can try different dampening settings.
Tracking camera exposure: The automatic exposure of the tracking cameras may not yet perform optimally in all environments, for example with very bright lights. Use the manual exposure to override the automatic exposure.
Restart tracking: In case the headset stops tracking, you can restart the tracking of the headset using the Restart Tracking Tasks button. This allows to reset the tracking without having to restart Varjo Base completely.

Note: By default, Varjo inside-out tracking uses the top cameras, and Varjo Controllers use the bottom cameras for tracking. Using the bottom cameras for both controller and inside-out tracking may result in suboptimal tracking performance for both. Also, if the view of the bottom cameras has been obstructed due to, for example, the headset being left on a table, tracking may be negatively affected. We recommend running Room Setup again to fix this.

Define presets and restore default settings

You can create your own presets  using the Save and Load buttons.

Press Reset button to restore the default settings.

XR-4 and XR-4 Focal Edition are available in our web store and through selected Varjo resellers to business customers in nearly 40 countries.

Augmented Reality

Augmented reality (AR) means that the user is experiencing their own actual reality while certain virtual elements are projected on top of it. A typical use of AR in the consumer space is smartphone applications. However, in mobile applications, the field of view is limited by the size of the mobile device, it occupies the user’s hand, and the experience is much less immersive than with a headset, as you are restricted to a flat screen. These kinds of simple solutions can work great for some use cases, such as games or entertainment (for example, Pokémon Go and Snapchat filters).

Most of today’s augmented reality headsets use optical see-through-based glasses that create holographic images to float in front of your eyes in a narrow, augmented window. The problem is that these images are hazy and ghostlike, because optical see-through devices can only display light, not black or opaque content. AR headsets must also make big compromises on the field of view, resolution, or both.

Currently, AR glasses aren’t anywhere near reaching the goal of “hard AR” – a level of simulation where digital and real objects are completely indistinguishable from each other. However, what AR glasses or goggles lack in visual detail, they often make up for it in portability and by being lightweight. Some AR glasses are also wireless, allowing users to wear them on the go.

Varjo inside-out tracking

We will help you set up tracking for your headset.

Varjo inside-out tracking is available for XR-4, and Varjo inside-out tracking (Beta) is available for XR-3. For other options, see the list of available tracking methods.

Positional tracking for your headset

Your Varjo headset uses a tracking system to know its exact position. Tracking allows applications to synchronize your movements in the real world with those in the virtual environment.

Varjo inside-out tracking uses the positional tracking cameras on the headset to continuously scan the room and keep track of your position. No additional accessories are required.

Note that to use OpenVR applications (such as SteamVR apps) with XR-4, you need to install SteamVR software.

With XR-3, OpenVR applications can only be used with SteamVR™ Tracking.

Set up Varjo inside-out tracking

Follow these steps to set up Varjo inside-out tracking for your headset. Before you set up tracking, you will need to start setup in Varjo Base and connect your headset.

1. Prepare your environment to use the headset safely

Before using the headset, clear the room of obstacles and hazards, people, furniture, and any other items to ensure that youhave enough spacebothabove and around you.

If possible, cover all reflective surfaces since they may interfere with tracking. Make sure that you have good lighting in the room when you set up and use the headset.

Read more about how to prepare your environment.

2. Put on and adjust your headset

You can now put on the headset.

3. Calibrate foveated rendering

Foveated rendering is calibrated whenever you put on the headset. Follow the instructions for calibration.

4 A. Adjust floor level and forward direction for XR-4

Adjust the floor level and forward direction of your tracking setup. This can be done with or without controllers.

The headset can remember where it was last used. Whenever you use the headset in a new environment, you will need to set up the room again

4 B. Calibrate Varjo inside-out tracking (Beta) for XR-3

Your headset scans the physical features of your room to calibrate Varjo inside-out tracking (Beta). Follow the instructions inside the headset to scan the room.

After calibration, you can adjust the floor level and forward direction of your tracking setup if needed.

The headset can remember where it was last used. Whenever you use the headset in a new environment, calibration will automatically start again.

Varjo inside-out tracking is now successfully set up and your headset is ready for use.

Frame rate

Frame rate is measured in frames per second (FPS). It is a measure of how many frames your graphics card (GPU) can send out to the display every second.

In order for virtual reality or mixed reality applications to perform well and not cause discomfort (Motion sickness and Cyber Sickness), especially if scenes contain movement, it is recommended to try to achieve as close to 90 frames per second as possible. For static scenes, 60 frames per second can be sufficient for shorter durations (a few minutes).

To reach these kinds of frame rates consistently, a powerful PC and typically the latest generation of VR supported graphics cards are required. Nowadays, PC hardware requirements for VR and XR headsets can be significantly reduced by leveraging cloud-based computing solutions such as Varjo Reality Cloud.

The term refresh rate is sometimes used interchangeably with frame rate, but the two are not the same thing, even if they are closely related. Where frame rate tells you how many frames your computer can send to display, refresh rate dictates how often your display itself is capable of renewing the displayed image.

No matter how powerful of a graphics card you have, it will not matter if the headset itself does not have a high enough refresh rate to display those frames. Generally speaking, a refresh rate of 90 Hz is optimal. A refresh rate lower than 90 Hz can increase the likelihood of virtual reality content causing eye strain or nausea. All Varjo XR-4 Series headsets and the Varjo Aero all have a refresh rate of 90 Hz.

Using existing VR/XR content

There is a large amount of existing VR/XR content and software available. Depending on the visual quality and other parameters, different content and applications also have varying hardware requirements.

Varjo headsets have native support for a broad range of 3D software and applications. In addition, any software is easily ported into Varjo via OpenXR or Varjo native SDK. All Varjo headsets are fully compatible with OpenVR & SteamVR games, but running the application in OpenVR mode means that some Varjo-specific features might not be available – such as human-eye resolution, foveation (= a rendering process that decreases image quality in peripheral vision), and advanced mixed reality functions.

For more information about VR content compatibility, see the list of Varjo-ready software.

Visit our Varjo Developer Site to access detailed guides and documentation on developing for the Varjo headset or making your existing VR/XR content compatible with our VR and XR.

VR accessories and peripherals.

Accessories and peripherals play a pivotal role in enhancing the VR experience. They can improve interactivity and comfort, making virtual reality an even more captivating and immersive realm. Whether you’re a gaming enthusiast or a professional user proper accessories can undoubtedly elevate your VR experience to new heights of excitement and realism.

One of the most popular peripherals for VR is the VR controller. These handheld devices come in various forms, providing users with a sense of presence and interactivity within the virtual environment. Equipped with motion sensors and buttons, these controllers enable users to navigate through virtual worlds, interact with objects, and perform various actions with natural hand movements. Varjo headsets are compatible with the most popular controllers such as the Valve Index.

Another essential peripheral is the VR sensor, also known as the tracking system. These devices, placed strategically in the user’s play area, track the movements of the headset and controllers, ensuring accurate positioning and smooth in-app interactions. High-quality tracking systems are essential for delivering a seamless and immersive VR experience. This is why Varjo headsets rely on outside-in tracking from external base stations or lighthouses. For 360 coverage, we recommend at least two Steam VR 2.0 base stations placed diagonally at the corners of the desired area.

VR headphones or earphones are also commonly used with VR headsets. These audio peripherals provide high-fidelity sound, crucial for enhancing immersion and situational awareness within the virtual environment. By precisely replicating sounds from different directions, users can pinpoint sources, heightening their overall gaming or multimedia experience. Audio requirements vary from use case to another, which is why all Varjo headsets have a 3,5mm audio jack to allow users to connect their preferred headphones to the HMD.

More impactful marketing and sales ROI with Varjo headsets

Improve revenue and profit through more effective marketing and sales experiences and reduce the need for physical inventory using immersive sales configurators.
Research and create more efficient and attention-grabbing store layouts and product packaging through eye tracking and realistic, lifesize digital twins of products or even entire stores.
Create unforgettable experiences with immersive demos in-store and at fairs and events.

Sales configurators improve profitability and upsell and reduce inventory needs.

Inventory is one of the biggest costs for any retailer store. This is even more true for companies selling high-priced, large products such as cars. Most of the time, it is simply impossible to carry every available product and product variant at any given store. As seeing is believing, this makes it harder for customers to find the best alternative and for salespeople to upsell more expensive variants. 

Interactive sales configurators can go a long way in solving this problem. Using lifesize, lifelike digital twins of products allows you to realistically show all possible product variants and customization options to a prospective customer, giving them a realistic sense of product proportions. This unlocks much better upsell opportunities, helps customers find exactly what they want and thus improves satisfaction, while simultaneously reducing the need for physical inventory. 

Case study: Arksen Yachts 

With multiple hands on deck, boatbuilder Arksen converted a digital showcase of their 85′ explorer yacht into a virtual reality experience – creating a new kind of sales configurator experience.

Develop more effective store layouts

Designing retail spaces is a complex endeavor. Traditional 2D presentations fall short when it comes to conveying store concepts accurately e.g. due to the inability to visualize spatial dimensions, while building physical store prototypes is slow and expensive. 

Shifting retail space design more extensively into digital models in virtual or mixed reality solves these issues and reduces cost by several dozen percent. 

In addition, eye tracking can be used to objectively measure where a potential shoppers gaze falls, proving what kind of layouts and promotions are the most attention-grabbing for example. 

Design more eye-catching products and packaging

Product and package design are incredibly crucial activities for brands across product categories such as consumer packaged goods (CPG), electronics, and fashion. Although product design is done digitally, it is still mostly constrained to 2D screens and depends on producing multiple variants of physical prototypes at different stages of the process. This limits remote collaboration and slows down iterations. 

For example, many fashion brands already have 3D digital twins of their products, but they are not utilizing this data in a 3D environment where they could be displayed in real-life scale and detail. 

Using mixed and virtual reality headsets, these 3D models can effectively be used for many applications such as remote designer collaboration, reducing the need for physical mockups, and testing how eye catching a product or packaging is through eye-tracking.

Create unforgettable in-store and event experiences 

You don’t always need to be strictly product centric. Immersive demos can create unforgettable customer experiences in-store and at events.

Japanese retail company MUJI harnessed virtual reality to achieve a deeper connection with their in-store customers, and the Varjo Aero enables crystal-clear communication of their core values.

Red Bull opened up an immersive museum exhibition in Lucerne, Switzerland, utilizing Varjo’s world-leading XR technology.

How to get started with VR: What do I need?

Looking to get started with virtual or mixed reality? With a few key pieces of hardware, you’ll be off to experiencing a world of endless opportunities in no time.

Head-mounted device
First, you’ll need a head-mounted device (HMD). These are typically wired via cables and tethered to a PC to enable high-fidelity graphics to be shown inside the device. The headset is worn on your head and over your eyes. This allows the HMD to output an application or scene to immerse the end user.
Compatible PC hardware
Next, you’ll want to use a PC that can run your application. This can either be a laptop or a desktop PC. While many variables can affect your system performance, the two main components are the physical connections and hardware available on the PC. You’ll want to ensure you have enough ports to plug the HMD into the PC successfully. You’ll also want to have a compatible graphics card and processor. The higher the graphics card and processor power, the smoother your application will run. A list of system requirements to run a Varjo HMD can be found here.
Controllers
You’ll also need a pair of controllers to interact with most applications. Controllers will allow you to interact with certain objects within the application. Depending on the HMD, controllers may not be required as certain devices have hand-tracking capabilities. This will enable you to extend and use your hands to interact with objects. To determine if you can leverage hand-tracking technology, you’ll want to ensure the application you’re running supports it.
Positional tracking system
For HMDs connected to a desktop PC, a tracking system is required for your play area. Various tracking systems are available, but the most common are SteamVR base stations. These small boxes are mounted and positioned in the corners of the room or play area. The base stations’ purpose is to track the precise movements of the HMD and the controllers. Depending on the size of the play area, anywhere from 1-5 base stations may be needed. For base stations to properly track the HMD, they must have a visible line of sight to each other. An example of how base stations should be set up can be found here.
Secure play area
Lastly, before putting on an HMD, you’ll need to identify a play area. A play area is typically a dedicated 10’x10′ squared-off space where you’ll wear the headset. You want to ensure that within this play area, there are no hazards that the person wearing the HMD can run into. If you do not have a 10’x10′ playing area, make sure that you have enough space to put on the HMD and that you can achieve a full range of motion with your arms without obstruction.

Once you have all of the above set up, you’ll have everything you need to start your journey.

How KPF is Transforming Architectural Visualization with Varjo’s Virtual Reality

KPF’s industry-leading teams are setting new standards in architectural visualization and collaboration with Varjo’s virtual reality, Twinmotion and Varjo Reality Cloud.

Benefits of VR/XR for architectural visualization:

Offering clients and design teams a lifelike experience of the full-scale design
Accelerated design decision-making process resulting in cost savings and saving anywhere from 5-50 % of time spent concepting
Ability to reduce the need for physical prototypes, saving resources and cutting down waste
Early decision-making helping to avoid unnecessary changes in the construction stage and saving time, labor, and materials

From Skyline Dominance to Pioneering Technology

Kohn Pedersen Fox (KPF) is one of the world’s most prestigious architecture firms, known for designing six of the world's twelve tallest skyscrapers. With offices in New York, San Francisco, London, Berlin, Shanghai, Hong Kong, Shenzhen, Seoul, and Singapore, their team of over 700 professionals typically engages with extremely large-scale and complex projects that are spearheading design innovation across the globe.

For KPF, driving large-scale, industry-leading projects has cultivated a culture that continuously strives for innovation and adoption of new advanced technologies. As a result, KPF’s teams in New York and London have been at the forefront of exploring various virtual reality solutions to optimize architectural workflows since the early days of the technology. They initially perceived VR primarily as a spatial analysis tool, but the perspective evolved into more use cases as the technology’s capabilities and visual accuracy matured.

Designers and architects are always on a quest for highest resolution, aiming to replicate the real world as precisely as possible to showcase a project’s final outcome. As the teams at KPF delved deeper into adopting immersive technologies, the limitations of earlier generation headsets became increasingly more evident.

In particular, older devices struggled with delivering the high-resolution output that KPF’s intricate projects demanded, and often stumbled when it came to compatibility with the firm’s preferred software tools. They needed a next-generation solution that could rise to the standards and bridge the gap between ideation and visualization with uncompromised fidelity.

A New Dimension in Design and Perception

The team found their match with the Varjo Aero, Varjo’s leading-edge VR headset which stood out due to its high-resolution capabilities and superior performance over competitors. With Varjo Aero’s high-precision visual fidelity, KPF can now go beyond just spatial analysis in virtual reality: they can scrutinize even the finest of details and are able to see what equates to a one-to-one representation of the real world. This level of realism holds the potential to transform both project workflows and client interactions.

“The Varjo headset significantly altered our designers’ perspective on what VR could offer,” says , Applied Research Project Innovation Manager at KPF New York. “The second we tried it, we kind of fell in love with it because it checks off all the things we needed in a headset.”

Although 3D architectural renderings have been used for many years, they’ve traditionally been confined to the two-dimensional limits of monitors or screens. VR-based visualization transcends this limitation by placing users directly into the architectural scene, offering a true sense of dimensions and reducing the need to grasp complex technical measurements. “The ability for architects to transport and immerse themselves within a virtual building model offers a unique perspective and better sensory feedback compared to viewing it on a screen or physical model,” explains Jonathan Dreyfus, Computational Practice Specialist at KPF London.

“As VR/XR technology becomes more hyper-realistic, I believe the industry will shift to use it more and more alongside traditional media. After all, why restrict yourself to a single image when you can experience a fully immersive and interactive environment?” notes Jonathan Dreyfus.

Better Feedback and Decision-Making

KPF’s London team set up a dedicated VR space for immersive client presentations. The studio is equipped with base stations and devices always ready to show clients high-immersion visualizations and help them experience projects firsthand before construction begins. This setup provides users with spatial understanding that helps with decision-making and forming feedback, elevating their understanding beyond just traditional drawings or physical mock-ups.

“Clients who try it generally express satisfaction with the experience. They’re able to pick up on details such as floor-to-ceiling height and views through windows that they might not have noticed in plans or other visuals,” Jonathan Dreyfus tells.

Through immersive visualization, clients can test design iterations, choose the best option, and save anywhere from 5% to 50% of concept time for the design teams. If the client is somewhat uncertain after reviewing conventional visuals, taking them into a VR experience can effectively dispel their doubts and expedite the decision-making process. “In some cases, a 30-minute VR session can save weeks of modeling, drafting, and presentations and translate to substantial savings,” Jonathan Dreyfus notes.

Seamless Transition to Advanced Visualization

For KPF, one of the main benefits of adopting Varjo’s virtual reality is its compatibility with various software tools like Twinmotion, Enscape, Unreal Engine, NVIDIA Omniverse, and VR plugins like Arkio and Prospect. What particularly stands out for the team is Varjo’s proactive approach in updates and support for these critical applications. “From the Varjo team, we receive instant help on upcoming updates or anything we encounter. Typically, we receive responses within minutes that either provide a solution or suggest a workaround,” says Andy Christoforou.  “This level of support is one of the reasons we want to stick with Varjo. We wouldn’t want to switch to a different headset that doesn’t support all the tools we use.”

The newly released support for Varjo’s VR and XR devices in Twinmotion now offers an invaluable bridge between VR and one of the industry’s leading real-time visualization tools. Twinmotion brings many powerful features that help with depicting and narrating KPF’s projects, many of which are exclusive to the platform. It also provides an efficient gateway to projects built with Unreal Engine, enabling the teams to create even more advanced interactive experiences.

This integration has been instrumental for KPF and has streamlined existing workflows: with just a few clicks, designers can now breathe life into their architectural designs by activating Twinmotion, selecting the VR mode, and immersing themselves in their 3D models directly through their Varjo headsets.

“For us it was critical to be able to directly plug the Varjo headsets into Twinmotion in a fuss-free way. The fact that we can simply hit play and the software connects directly to the headset has been a huge time-saver,” says Jonathan Dreyfus.

Redefining VR for Professional Use with Varjo Reality Cloud

Additional controls to central management of design iterations
Easier design sharing between teams, colleagues and clients
Reduced local hardware requirements for visualizing complex 3D models

KPF was the first architecture firm to experiment with Varjo Reality Cloud, Varjo’s cloud streaming service for immersive content. With Varjo Reality Cloud, KPF’s teams can upload VR/XR visualizations to the cloud, allowing colleagues and clients to then browse and stream design iterations to VR headsets or other devices regardless of time or place.

KPF’s teams were profoundly impressed with Varjo Reality Cloud and feel that its streaming quality and low latency have the potential to rival local computing. “Reality Cloud is one of my favorite aspects of Varjo’s offering. I find it to be an incredibly impressive solution, almost akin to the “Holy Grail” of VR, something that hasn’t been realized until now,” Andy Christoforou praises.

Given the shift to hybrid work, many of KPF’s designers often rely on laptops and have limited access to high-performance computers. Varjo Reality Cloud is able to bridge this gap, eliminating the need for advanced hardware setups and giving greater version control for teams to manage sharing of their latest design iterations. “The ability to easily upload large scenes to the Reality Cloud and then hop in without any concern about hardware management resolves a significant pain point for the team,” Andy Christoforou explains.

“Varjo Reality Cloud is almost akin to the "Holy Grail" of VR, something that hasn't been realized until now.”

Varjo XR-3, the first true mixed reality headset.

Varjo XR-3 delivers the most immersive mixed reality experience ever constructed, featuring photorealistic visual fidelity across the widest field of view of any XR headset. And with depth awareness, real and virtual elements blend together naturally.

Unmatched mixed reality performance.

Varjo XR-3

Photorealistic, true-to-life mixed reality powered by low-latency, 12-megapixel video pass-through.
The industry’s highest resolution (over 70 ppd) and the widest field of view (115°).
The widest-ever color gamut matches 99% with sRGB and 93% with DCI-P3 color space for the most realistic scenes ever produced.
Depth awareness powered by LiDAR for pixel-perfect real-time occlusion and 3D world reconstruction.
Integrated Ultraleap hand tracking and integrated 200 Hz eye tracking for natural interactions.
Inside-out tracking (beta), offering flexibility for deployments without the need for base stations.

Watch our demo made with Unity, showing realistic reflections, shadows and lights for a true-to-life mixed reality experience.

Welcome to the only photorealistic mixed reality.

The world’s only human-eye resolution (over 70 PPD) mixed reality headset with the widest field of view (115 degrees) guarantees the most naturally immersive mixed reality experience ever constructed.

With precise and individually calibrated colors for unmatched realism, the Varjo XR-3 sets a new industry standard for visual fidelity across realities.

Change reality as you know it.

Varjo’s mixed reality technology uses video pass-through that is vastly superior to the standard optical see-through systems used in other augmented reality headsets – making Varjo XR-3 the only device where virtual objects look real instead of appearing as holographic augmentations.

With ultra-low latency (< 20 ms) and a high-fidelity 12-megapixel video stream, you can explore true-to-life virtual visualizations as natural extensions of the real world. You can also effortlessly switch between XR, AR, and VR.

 This image simulates what you see when you look through an optical see-through device compared to Varjo's video pass-through based mixed reality. Varjo XR-3 image rendered with Autodesk VRED.

Compatible with the 3D applications you already use.

Varjo’s XR/VR headsets are compatible with a fast-growing number of professional 3D platforms and software, including Unity, Unreal Engine, OpenXR 1.0, Autodesk VRED, PREPAR3D, and VBS Blue IG among others.

See all supported software

Industry-first LiDAR for mixed reality.

Varjo XR-3 depth awareness combines the LiDAR sensor and stereo RGB video feed to set a new benchmark for hand, object and people occlusion – pixel-perfectly blending real and virtual elements. And with real-time 3D room reconstructions, you can easily build realistic immersive environments of your surroundings.

Use hands naturally and intuitively with Ultraleap, the world’s most advanced hand tracking. It captures all the complexities of your natural hand movements to precisely replicate real-life interactions with either virtual or real contents.

And with Varjo’s built-in eye tracking at 200 Hz powering foveated rendering, the headset shows what the user is directly looking at in full resolution. Similar to how the human eye works. You can also utilize the eye tracking data for sophisticated training analysis or research purposes.

Perform in total comfort with the most advanced ergonomic design.

Varjo XR-3 is designed with a 3-point precision fit headband to enable maximum comfort for all head shapes and sizes, even during longer immersive sessions. Automatic IPD, active cooling, frame rate, and our ultra-wide, crystal clear non-Fresnel lenses ensure that you can work comfortably without any eye strain or simulator sickness. With hygienic, easy-to-clean materials, the headset is suitable for multi-user setups. You can also use the Varjo XR-3 comfortably with glasses.

Highest-level security and privacy.

Varjo XR-3 can be deployed even in the highest-security environments, as we support information assurance procedures and requirements. There are no automatic or forced downloads, no personal data is collected, and we don’t transmit any data away from the devices. You also have the option to remove the RF transmitter used by the controllers when operating in a secure setting.

In case your organization would like to use Varjo XR-3 without access to the internet, we also offer an offline version of the . Please contact our Varjo sales experts for more information.

Controller is not connected. Power on your controller to connect.

Calibrating Varjo inside-out tracking

Varjo inside-out tracking uses the positional tracking cameras on the headset to continuously scan the room and keep track of your position while you are using the headset.

Tracking is calibrated when you set up Varjo inside-out tracking and a new calibration is started automatically whenever you use the headset in a new environment. The headset can remember where it was last used and no calibration is needed in the same environment.

You can manually start a new calibration at any time as follows:

XR-4

Navigate to the System tab in Varjo Base.
Under Tracking select Recalibrate floor level.

XR-3

Navigate to the System tab in Varjo Base.
Under Headset tracking, make sure that Varjo inside-out tracking (Beta) is selected.
Start Varjo inside-out tracking (Beta) calibration.

Read more about preparing your environment.

Forward direction and origin

When using Varjo inside-out tracking, you can quickly adjust the forward direction, origin point, and floor level of your tracking environment. This is useful if, for example, you want an application to start in another direction.

You can adjust the tracking setup as follows:

In Varjo Base, navigate to the System tab and select Forward direction and origin. Alternatively, open the Menu and select the shortcut for Forward direction and origin.
Move to the location you want to set as the origin point of your tracking environment.
Face the direction you want the content to appear from.
If needed, press the up and down arrow keys on your keyboard to align the virtual grid with the floor level. Push Reset with your finger if you want to return the grid to its original level.
When ready, push Confirm with your finger.

SteamVR™ Tracking

Device statuses in Varjo Base

The tracking status of your headset is displayed in the status area in Varjo Base. With SteamVR™ Tracking, your base stations and optional controllers are listed as well.

Device is connected and tracking.

Device is connected but tracking is not working. Tracking may be temporarily lost if the device is not in direct line of sight with the base stations.

 Start SteamVR room setup.

Perform this setup whenever you start to use the headset and base stations in a new environment, or if you move the base stations in your current environment.

Read more about preparing your environment.

Override origin and direction

When using SteamVR™ Tracking, you can override the origin point, direction, and floor level of your room setup in Varjo Base. This can help you temporarily fix tracking-related problems, such as your application starting in the wrong direction or virtual content drifting out of place.

The override feature applies to your headset by default. Other trackables, such as controllers, are affected if your application supports the feature.

Note that this feature is intended to be a temporary fix only. We recommend you carefully check your tracking environment and perform a new room setup in SteamVR to correct problems related to tracking.

Follow the instructions to adjust your room setup:

 Place your headset in the location where you want to start the scene and point it in the desired direction.
 In Varjo Base, navigate to the System tab and select Override origin and direction. The Override button text will change to Active.
 If needed, set the headset elevation in centimeters under Headset elevation from floor.

While the override setting is active, your application will use the adjusted room setup over the original one.

Return to your original room setup by clicking the Active button.

If you encounter a problem with your Varjo product or service that requires help from Varjo Support team, collecting diagnostics can help to solve the issue quickly. Using Varjo Base, you can collect information about your Varjo system and send it to Varjo Support for troubleshooting.

To start diagnostics collection, go to Support tab > Troubleshooting > Diagnostics.

With some Varjo headsets you can choose what diagnostics you want to gather:

Eye camera (XR-4, XR-3, VR-3, and Aero):

Recording of headset’s eye camera for troubleshooting eye tracking related issues.

Varjo inside-out tracking (XR-4, XR-3):

Recording of headset’s front cameras for troubleshooting inside-out tracking related issues.

Recording of controllers for troubleshooting tracking and connection issues.

Additionally, diagnostics information includes for example the following:

Varjo system log files, including system events and error messages.
Computer hardware configuration, including, for example, motherboard, processor, graphics card, memory.
Computer OS and installed software: Windows version, Varjo Base version, SteamVR version (if installed).
Connected headset information: headset serial number, firmware version.
Connected peripherals information: for example, third-party controllers, and trackers.

When sending diagnostics, we ask you to provide an email address (mandatory) and additional notes and attachments (optional) to Varjo for contacting you about your support request.

You can choose to send all or only part of the diagnostic files to Varjo. You can always review and edit all diagnostic files before sending them to Varjo. Varjo Base never sends diagnostics automatically.

You can choose to help our product development and allow sending automatic crash reports to Varjo in case the system malfunctions. This feature can be controlled from Varjo Base.
Crash reports include Varjo system log files, including system events and error messages. Crash reports do not contain your personal data.
Varjo System does not report crashes without your permission.

Software and firmware updates

You can download software and firmware updates for your headset and Varjo Controllers either in Varjo Base or manually from Varjo Account Portal. We recommend that you always use the latest supported software and firmware for your headset.

Note that you will need a Varjo Account to download updates.

Automatic software and firmware updates

To enable automatic software and firmware updates, navigate to the Support tab and enable Automatically check for updates. This allows Varjo Base to automatically check and display a notification when updates are available. Varjo Base will always ask for your permission to install updates.

Manual software and firmware updates

To manually check for software and firmware updates, navigate to the Support tab and select either Varjo Base software update, Headset firmware update, or Controller firmware update (XR-4). If a newer version is available, select Download and follow the instructions to update.

For computers without internet access, you can download the files on another computer, copy the installation file over to your computer, and install.

While a firmware update is running, open View details to follow its progress. The update process may take a while, during which your headset will restart several times. Do not disconnect the headset, quit Varjo Base, or turn off your computer while the update is in progress.

If the firmware update is not successfully completed, we recommend that you run it a second time. If you still encounter a problem, please contact Varjo Support.

Important:  Only use Varjo Base to install firmware updates for your headset and controllers. Never attempt to update the firmware using the SteamVR application. If SteamVR suggests you update the firmware, please ignore the notification.

Spatial Computing / Immersive Computing

Immersive or spatial computing is an umbrella concept for a range of technologies that digitize the activities of machines, people, and objects and the environments in which they take place. Spatial computing was first defined in 2003 by MIT researcher Simon Greenwold in his graduate thesis as “human interaction with a machine in which the machine retains and manipulates referents to real objects and spaces”.

Augmented reality, virtual reality, and mixed reality are just three examples of spatial computing (also known as immersive computing), where glasses or headsets can be used to display virtual content to the wearer. GPS, QR codes, or smart device speech recognition could also be considered applications of spatial computing.

In immersive computing, the user no longer interacts with a computer as an outsider and is instead a participant in a 3D environment where space is no longer an abstract notion.

Since Varjo was founded, we have always believed that for the immersive computing revolution to happen, we would need to bridge the present and the future with the world’s best VR/XR hardware, the most powerful software, and a user interface that frees us from the constraints of the physical world.

What’s the difference between PCVR, standalone, wireless, and tethered headsets?

PCVR / Tethered VR Headset

A tethered VR headset needs to be physically connected to a computer (typically a fairly powerful PC) to function properly. While this means mobility is limited, it also has some key benefits.

A tethered device does not require a separate battery, so a considerable amount of weight is freed up for other purposes.
This way, devices can be made lighter, or they can house better optics or other more advanced but heavier components.
As the processing of visual elements is offloaded to a more powerful computer, tethered VR headsets can have better visual quality than any other kind of VR headset.

Varjo XR-3, the most advanced PCVR mixed reality headset available on the market.

Best PCVR headset for consumers: Varjo Aero has been awarded as the best PCVR headset at Augmented World Expo, as “one of the best PCVR solutions available to consumers” by Digital Trends, and as “the most sumptuous consumer VR headset you can currently get your hands on” by Financial Times.

Wireless VR headsets work without being tethered to a computer, but they still require a computer and some form of companion software to run properly. There is a very wide range of executions in this device category.  

For example, there are separate wireless kits or modules sold for some tethered VR headsets, which allow them to be used without cables. However, this typically comes at the cost of graphics quality, and you need to be connected to a PC with a cable if the user wants the full visual quality offered by the device.  
As these devices are still connected to an associated computer, it also means that they typically support a larger number of software than standalone devices.

As the name implies, standalone VR headsets are wireless and do not require an accompanying computer to work.  

The full operating system is contained inside the headset. You might be able to connect them to a computer for charging or other functionality, but this is fully optional. 
As all of the computation has to be handled inside the headset, it places restrictions on the visual quality that can be achieved. 
It also means the device needs to have a battery to function. 
Different standalone VR headsets also have very different operating systems, which means that they might not support all VR applications available on headsets that require an associated PC.

Calibrating Varjo inside-out tracking

Varjo inside-out tracking uses the positional tracking cameras on the headset to continuously scan the room and keep track of your position while you are using the headset.

Tracking is calibrated when you set up Varjo inside-out tracking and a new calibration is started automatically whenever you use the headset in a new environment. The headset can remember where it was last used and no calibration is needed in the same environment.

You can manually start a new calibration at any time as follows:

XR-4

Navigate to the System tab in Varjo Base.
Under Tracking select Recalibrate floor level.

XR-3

Navigate to the System tab in Varjo Base.
Under Headset tracking, make sure that Varjo inside-out tracking (Beta) is selected.
Start Varjo inside-out tracking (Beta) calibration.

Read more about preparing your environment.

Forward direction and origin

When using Varjo inside-out tracking, you can quickly adjust the forward direction, origin point, and floor level of your tracking environment. This is useful if, for example, you want an application to start in another direction.

You can adjust the tracking setup as follows:

In Varjo Base, navigate to the System tab and select Forward direction and origin. Alternatively, open the Menu and select the shortcut for Forward direction and origin.
Move to the location you want to set as the origin point of your tracking environment.
Face the direction you want the content to appear from.
If needed, press the up and down arrow keys on your keyboard to align the virtual grid with the floor level. Push Reset with your finger if you want to return the grid to its original level.
When ready, push Confirm with your finger.

 Start SteamVR room setup.

Perform this setup whenever you start to use the headset and base stations in a new environment, or if you move the base stations in your current environment.

Read more about preparing your environment.

Override origin and direction

When using SteamVR™ Tracking, you can override the origin point, direction, and floor level of your room setup in Varjo Base. This can help you temporarily fix tracking-related problems, such as your application starting in the wrong direction or virtual content drifting out of place.

The override feature applies to your headset by default. Other trackables, such as controllers, are affected if your application supports the feature.

Note that this feature is intended to be a temporary fix only. We recommend you carefully check your tracking environment and perform a new room setup in SteamVR to correct problems related to tracking.

Follow the instructions to adjust your room setup:

 Place your headset in the location where you want to start the scene and point it in the desired direction.
 In Varjo Base, navigate to the System tab and select Override origin and direction. The Override button text will change to Active.
 If needed, set the headset elevation in centimeters under Headset elevation from floor.

While the override setting is active, your application will use the adjusted room setup over the original one.

Return to your original room setup by clicking the Active button.

If you encounter a problem with your Varjo product or service that requires help from Varjo Support team, collecting diagnostics can help to solve the issue quickly. Using Varjo Base, you can collect information about your Varjo system and send it to Varjo Support for troubleshooting.

To start diagnostics collection, go to Support tab > Troubleshooting > Diagnostics.

With some Varjo headsets you can choose what diagnostics you want to gather:

Eye camera (XR-4, XR-3, VR-3, and Aero):

Recording of headset’s eye camera for troubleshooting eye tracking related issues.

Varjo inside-out tracking (XR-4, XR-3):

Recording of headset’s front cameras for troubleshooting inside-out tracking related issues.

Computer OS and installed software: Windows version, Varjo Base version, SteamVR version (if installed).
Connected headset information: headset serial number, firmware version.
Connected peripherals information: for example, third-party controllers, and trackers.

When sending diagnostics, we ask you to provide an email address (mandatory) and additional notes and attachments (optional) to Varjo for contacting you about your support request.

You can choose to send all or only part of the diagnostic files to Varjo. You can always review and edit all diagnostic files before sending them to Varjo. Varjo Base never sends diagnostics automatically.

You can choose to help our product development and allow sending automatic crash reports to Varjo in case the system malfunctions. This feature can be controlled from Varjo Base.
Crash reports include Varjo system log files, including system events and error messages. Crash reports do not contain your personal data.
Varjo System does not report crashes without your permission.

Software and firmware updates

You can download software and firmware updates for your headset and Varjo Controllers either in Varjo Base or manually from Varjo Account Portal. We recommend that you always use the latest supported software and firmware for your headset.

Note that you will need a Varjo Account to download updates.

Automatic software and firmware updates

To enable automatic software and firmware updates, navigate to the Support tab and enable Automatically check for updates. This allows Varjo Base to automatically check and display a notification when updates are available. Varjo Base will always ask for your permission to install updates.

Manual software and firmware updates

To manually check for software and firmware updates, navigate to the Support tab and select either Varjo Base software update, Headset firmware update, or Controller firmware update (XR-4). If a newer version is available, select Download and follow the instructions to update.

For computers without internet access, you can download the files on another computer, copy the installation file over to your computer, and install.

While a firmware update is running, open View details to follow its progress. The update process may take a while, during which your headset will restart several times. Do not disconnect the headset, quit Varjo Base, or turn off your computer while the update is in progress.

If the firmware update is not successfully completed, we recommend that you run it a second time. If you still encounter a problem, please contact Varjo Support.

Important:  Only use Varjo Base to install firmware updates for your headset and controllers. Never attempt to update the firmware using the SteamVR application. If SteamVR suggests you update the firmware, please ignore the notification.

Panasonic Automotive Powers Innovative Vehicle UX Design with Varjo's Virtual Reality

Panasonic Automotive is spearheading a transformative wave in the future of mobility. By harnessing the expansive potential of immersive technologies, they create immersive and holistic experiences that prioritize safety and meaningful interactions.

Foundation of a Sustainable Mobility Society

Panasonic Automotive Systems Company of America develops, produces, and sells advanced solutions and technologies to business customers in the automotive industry.

The company collaborates with a wide range of clients spanning various industries and scales, with Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) like GM, Ford, Chrysler, Toyota, Honda, and Subaru representing one fraction of their diverse partnership network. Their mission is to create a sustainable mobility society for the betterment of each individual’s life.

At the forefront of Panasonic Automotive’s technological advancements is the development of Augmented Reality Head-Up Displays (AR HUD), an innovative user interface designed to augment the driver’s field of view and situational awareness within a vehicle.

The AR HUD leverages either 2D or 3D visuals to project crucial information in front of the driver during the drive with the goal of enhancing driver safety and spatial awareness. For instance, AR HUDs can be used to project a pathway on the road, showing you exactly where to go, or to highlight real-world hazards or points of interest.

Challenges of the Traditional UX Design Process

Panasonic Automotive’s Advanced Engineering UX Design Department, situated in Farmington Hills, Michigan, is central to the company’s efforts in creating mobility innovations for the future. The department’s UX team specializes in user experience and design, working on diverse projects ranging from the cockpit driver experience to AR HUDs, Wi-Fi cameras, premium audio systems, and more.

Traditionally the process was linear.  UX designers typically begin by crafting a visual concept, then engineering proceeded to find technical solutions to meet the UX expectations. However, UX designers didn’t have a way to test the user experience until the functional prototype was available in the vehicle months later,  leaving UX teams with limited time to make improvements later in the process.

Current development of HUDs is associated with challenges with high development cost due to windshields being tailored to a specific vehicle, and their user experience not being fully perceivable until operational within the vehicle. Design teams strive for the ‘fail fast’ design philosophy that advocates testing numerous options early, but this can become costly because all the experiences need to be re-engineered to suit different vehicles.

In the past, designers would do simulations in technical software or present their designs with different documents, drawings, or renderings, but none of these methods truly convey the reality of the final solution.

UX Design Shifts VR to the Forefront

For Panasonic Automotive, adopting immersive technologies became a pivotal force in conquering many workflow challenges. Utilizing Varjo’s virtual reality, the UX team at Panasonic Automotive is capable of crafting high-fidelity virtual prototypes in the development process of HUDs and other cockpit experiences, enabling testing of the end-user experience.

Instead of waiting for a development team to write software, then having it flashed into the hardware, and finally set up a time to test drive the car, all these steps can be done simultaneously in VR, enabling swift changes. “We can do all of this in VR and review it before a functional prototype is built, which is highly beneficial,” says , UX Design Sr. Manager at Panasonic Automotive.

This pre-emptive testing in VR allows the team to guide specifications for an improved end-user experience, test various use cases and scenarios all at once, and even simulate tests within the vehicle setting. The use of VR has shifted the UX design stage to much earlier in the process, simplifying iterative design and providing an innovative approach in vehicle experience.

Innovative VR UX Design Hands-on Experiences

One of the advanced solutions built by Panasonic Automotive’s team is a simulation utilizing the Varjo headset that can transport their virtual experience beyond the confines of the lab. This immersive setup allows for real-time customer feedback on various design elements and enables users to navigate virtual scenarios, such as driving in varying lighting and weather conditions.

“The ability to simulate the experience of sitting in a car and driving gives a much more accurate understanding of the proposed designs than a CAD simulation or a rendering of the solution,” Kobayashi explains.

“It feels closer and more relatable. It’s vital to allow all involved to experience it before it’s implemented into a vehicle.”

Immersive Mood Rooms Convey Brand Essence

Virtual reality is also used to construct ‘mood rooms’ – immersive environments mirroring the design essence of Panasonic Automotive Premium Audio Brands. These virtual environments serve as “living room”-styled spaces, created to inspire customers by embodying the potential ambiance and design essence of what a future automotive space could bring.

“The use of VR headsets means that customers can be instantly transported to an environment that is completely tailored to the brand,” says Joe Perry, Senior UI Designer at Panasonic Automotive. “Whether we’re showcasing to customers at a trade show or to partners in different countries, VR provides a flexible and immersive way to communicate the brand’s essence.”

VR Empowers Panasonic Automotive to Iterate and Create Effectively

Virtual reality has emerged as a game-changer for Panasonic Automotive, empowering the team to iterate and visualize experiences before they are brought to life, identifying potential challenges early and paving the way for effective solution design. This iterative and proactive approach ultimately leads to significant time and cost savings and a higher quality end-product.

VR offers a safe and cost-effective platform for exploring new areas and testing various scenarios and environments in a safe context.  “With VR, we can sidestep potential safety hazards, physical limitations, and time constraints, and focus on learning and innovating,” Kobayashi says.

Moreover, immersive technology assists Panasonic Automotive in communicating ideas and showcasing expected end-user experiences to anyone they collaborate with. The ability to identify and iterate on issues upfront, test them, and share findings with stakeholders makes it much easier to steer the project in the right direction from the start. “A key benefit is the ability to simulate hardware months in advance. Before ground is even broken on a project, we often have a VR model to present. This allows us to directly illustrate potential pain points much earlier than before,” Perry tells.

The team at Panasonic Automotive highlights the high-resolution capability of the Varjo headset as the standout feature that effectively complements their designs. “We’ve had an overwhelmingly positive experience working with the Varjo headset,” says Perry. “UX testing in VR is often challenging with lower-resolution headsets due to the screen door effect, making it hard to identify minor UX elements. The high-resolution capacity of the Varjo XR-3 removes this obstacle, enabling comprehensive UX testing.”

Broadened Horizons with Immersive Technologies

Panasonic Automotive is committed to staying at the forefront of technological innovation, constantly pushing boundaries to enhance their operational efficiency and service delivery. Next, the UX team aims to explore new areas in immersive technologies, such as mixed reality and remote collaboration, to improve communication and enable conducting reviews remotely as effectively as if they were in person.

“With this technology, possibilities are endless. It enables us to create various scenarios, use cases, and immersive experiences,” says Kobayashi.

As the automotive industry gravitates towards widespread implementation of digital twins, VR/XR is set to seamlessly integrate into the design and development work cycle for UX design. The UX team at Panasonic Automotive sees the major driving factor being the ability to understand the implications of design choices years before the actual vehicle can be manufactured.

“User experience is going to be a key design and business priority in the future of mobility and Panasonic’s commitment to providing meaningful mobility experiences. Leveraging advanced technologies like VR, we aim to introduce added value and safety into every journey,” says Kobayashi.

Capturing VR or XR experiences

Foveated rendering is a rendering technique that uses an eye tracker integrated into a headset to reduce the image quality of the content being rendered in the user’s peripheral vision. The area that is not in the user’s focus gets blurred. The goal of the technique is to give users the best visual quality possible by using the least amount of computational resources.

All Varjo VR and XR headsets have foveated rendering capabilities. However, the feature only works if it is also supported by the application being used.

Why use foveated rendering?

Using foveated rendering is beneficial because lowering the image quality in the user’s peripheral vision improves system performance. This is because approximately 30-50% fewer pixels need to be rendered on Varjo headsets when using this technique (the exact amount depends on image quality settings and other factors).

Foveated rendering makes sense because a person can see with the highest resolution only at the center of the eye’s field of view and can detect much fewer details and colors in the periphery. This means that rendering things in full resolution in a person’s peripheral vision is essentially wasted because the eye cannot see the full detail.

With integrated eye tracking, a VR or XR headset can take advantage of this phenomenon and reduce the resolution in the user’s peripheral vision, so the rendering requires fewer resources. The user won’t be able to tell the difference in visual quality because the resolution change in the person’s peripheral vision is not observable, but the user will still benefit from the improved system performance.

Case Explico: How Mixed Reality Helps Forensic Engineers Educate Jurors in the Courtroom

Explico is developing mixed reality solutions to help prove complex issues to juries in the courtroom. Using Varjo headsets, the company can present fully-immersive and accurate reconstructions of various scenarios, demonstrating what happened and helping to reach a resolution.

Unraveling the details of what happened

Founded in 2013, Explico’s primary objective has always been to be the very best forensic engineering services firm on the planet. Explico specializes in using cutting edge technology to investigate, analyze, and visualize complex problems associated with accidents and failures. The end goal of these investigations is not just to determine what happened, but to be able to explain it to a wide audience, including potential jurors in a court of law.

Did the specific lighting conditions and nearby structures affect a driver’s ability to perceive the distance of an oncoming motorcycle or passing pedestrian? Was a downed powerline open and obvious to a nearby individual walking by? Did a carpeting’s pattern create an optical illusion thereby obscuring a step, which ultimately caused an individual to fall and become injured? Legal matters involving accidents, failures and even serious crimes often hinge on whether one side can effectively communicate critical, complex issues to the jury.

Answering these questions objectively is not easy. To help prove what happened and effectively communicate it to a jury, 3D animations have long since become an important tool in courtrooms because they can convey very complex issues in a compelling and understandable way. Example use cases include showing a scene of a crime, illustrating the inner workings of a failed mechanical device, and demonstrating the events that lead to an injury.

In these cases, accuracy is paramount. Accurate, high-fidelity representations of objects and environments can be generated from 3D laser scanning (LiDAR) devices. These 3D reconstructions and animations are more informative than traditional photographs or video, but they still have limitations. 

The biggest challenge is that 3D content is still being viewed on traditional 2D screens. This results in a lack of immersion and interactivity. Even the most detailed 3D animation, when viewed on a conventional display, will not be able to provide the sense of space and depth that is available in XR. Consequently, for certain accidents and issues, XR’s ability to provide an immediate understanding of what a person may have observed from their perspective, could provide critical understanding to jurors when reaching a verdict.

Things are about to change, though. Immersive technology is already revolutionizing how 3D scenes and animations are used in mediations, and it won’t be long before virtual and mixed reality headsets make their way to the courtroom. And at the heart of this development are Explico’s Steve Rundell, PhD, PE and Steve Arndt, PhD, CHFP.

The challenge: Using an immersive virtual experience for more accurate depictions of events

 Explico uses an individual’s own hands in order to navigate the scene of this ladder accident. Using this technology, Explico avoids the need to train jurors on complicated hand controllers making navigation intuitive and controlled.

One of Explico’s unique areas of expertise is using 3D engines such as Unity and Unreal Engine to create amazing, highly accurate interactive 3D models and animations that show what happened. This has led them to work on numerous high-profile cases where precisely proving the course of events, and being able to convey that understanding to a jury, is essential.

Explico’s goal has always been to make the experience even better by leveraging the latest technologies. To overcome the limitations of 2D screens, Explico decided to explore immersive technologies as a potential solution. 

The reason they chose mixed reality over virtual reality was simple: the possibilities of this technology are far more flexible, and the experience is far more intuitive to non-technical users and less jarring to people not accustomed to virtual reality, which includes most judges and jurors.

The solution: Varjo mixed reality

While Explico had tried other headsets before, Varjo’s industry-leading resolution and ease of use proved to be a great match for their needs. 

Varjo has allowed them to present fully-immersive and accurate reconstructions of various scenarios, clearly demonstrating what happened or was observable, and helping reach a resolution such as a settlement. Thanks to hand tracking and automatic IPD adjustment, the headset is also easily usable by any kind of user, no matter what their proficiency level with immersive technologies might be.

Varjo has been vital for Explico’s work. The visual quality and the seamless blend of the real world and the virtual world ensures that when someone is wearing a headset, real-world conditions can be presented accurately. Visual acuity needs to be close enough to real life for the technology to bring value, and Varjo achieves this in an unmatched way. For example, it is possible to show what an individual would actually be presented with since objects look natural and unpixelated – something no other headset can realistically achieve. 

 In a yacht accident case, a person was touring a yacht and missed a single step down into a room, leading them to break their ankle. Relatives of the injured party took a photo of the step and claimed it was obscured due to an optical illusion created by the carpet’s pattern. However, when people were put in VR and shown the same location, it was immediately apparent to everyone that there was a step down, highlighting the technology's potential for accurately conveying depth perception.

Visualizing Scenes in a User-Friendly Way

“Varjo’s technology is perfect for our needs. The visual quality is unmatched, and thanks to features like hand tracking and automatic IPD adjustment, even users without any previous experience with these technologies can easily use them with no additional training or discomfort.

With Varjo we are taking the ability to convey depth, size, and spatial awareness to a whole new level.”

STEVE RUNDELL – PRINCIPAL ENGINEER, EXPLICO ENGINEERING COMPANY

Mixed reality also makes the experience less jarring than being immersed in a fully virtual scene right from the start. This is especially useful with people who might not even have heard of virtual reality before and do not necessarily know what to expect when they are put in such a scene.

Ease of use is extremely important once headsets are used in legal proceedings. Jurors, judges and lawyers cannot be expected to be proficient in working with headsets. The technology needs to be intuitive to any kind of user. Once this technology is deployed in jury trials, there simply won’t be time to teach each and every juror to operate controllers, navigate complex settings, or adjust interpupillary distances so they don’t get nauseous. 

This is why accurate and natural hand tracking is a must have: there is no need for learning any kind of controller once a person can simply use their own hands to interact with an environment. Automatic IPD removes the need for manual visual calibration so the device can simply be put on and adjusted with the click of a single button, without any expertise needed from the user. This ensures that there is no eye strain, everything can be seen clearly, and there is no cyber sickness.

Another major benefit of this technology is that it can show events in real-life scale inside the courtroom, something that would be impossible with physical objects and places alone. For example, it is simply not realistic to bring large machines or vehicles into a courtroom, or expect a jury or judge to travel to the actual accident site in every single case.

The technology was also relatively easy to take into use as the Explico team was already using Unity to create 3D animations. Converting them for use with an XR headset was simply a natural step forward.

The result: Immersive scenes will be the future of courtroom animations

The investigation of a yacht accident serves as a prime example of how VR/XR technology can be leveraged in courtroom cases. Photos alone may not accurately convey depth, but in VR, users can move their head around and gain a clear understanding of the scene in a way that no photo can convey.

While not deployed during a jury trial within the United States yet, these immersive solutions have already been used as part of arbitration and mediation proceedings that ended up in a settlement outside the courtroom. Judges and arbitrators have already been able to view scenarios in mixed reality. It’s only a matter of time until jurors do so as well.

However, given how compelling many of these interactive demonstrations are using the Varjo headset, Steve Rundell of Explico anticipates that most cases will settle prior to trial. Specifically, once one side has had an opportunity to experience the other side’s compelling and interactive VR experience, they won’t want to run the risk of having a jury be exposed to the same evidence. Consequently, many lawyers will fight to keep VR out of the courtroom if it doesn’t aid in their case. Fortunately, a combination of Varjo’s incredibly high visual acuity combined with Explico’s previous and future peer-reviewed research will make exclusion of this evidence difficult for attorneys. 

Explico’s Steve Rundell sees that it is only a matter of time before the technology is deployed during a jury trial as well, and thanks to Varjo, Explico is ready to be a part of that monumental shift. He believes the first cases where the technology is going to be used will most likely end up in court fairly soon – perhaps already this year.

“The technology has reached a sufficient level of maturity to become widely adopted. It has the chance to revolutionize court proceedings, especially in tricky cases where you need to depict something that can only be depicted in XR. For example, nobody wanted to touch animations in the 80’s, but they are now a staple in many court cases. I predict a similar shift towards extended reality will happen eventually, because the degree of accuracy and how well it can reflect the real world is simply unmatched, and Varjo is a perfect device for making that happen,” Rundell says.

Eye Tracker in VR

Eye tracking in VR (or gaze tracking) is a technology for measuring the gaze direction of a user. When combined with positional head tracking, one can determine the exact point the user is looking at in the real or virtual world. Apart from detecting the point of interest, the system provides information about fixations (whether a user is focusing on something), saccades, and other eye motion patterns such as blinking and pupil dilation. This technology can have enormous benefits for researchers or application developers, as they can study human behavior in virtual environments or create interactions solely based on the user’s gaze.

Eye tracking is already widely utilized in many fields of research, including marketing, psychology, medicine, usability, and user behavior. It also has many important use cases in VR/AR and is rapidly becoming a standard feature in high-end headsets. Examples include automatic inter-pupillary distance (IPD) adjustment, detecting when a headset is worn, and automated user detection through iris recognition. It can also be used as a control mechanism in user interfaces, and to improve the realism of social avatars.

Varjo XR-4 Series headsets all have integrated eye tracking functions with 1-degree accuracy.

Capturing VR or XR experiences

Base stations, also known as ‘lighthouses’, track the exact location of your headset by sweeping the room using wireless pulses and laser lines. Full 360° coverage of your surroundings can usually be achieved with two base stations, enabling a fully immersive virtual reality experience, but you may require more depending on the size and accuracy of the desired coverage. When set up correctly, this positional tracking system enables you to move anywhere in your space and re-orient yourself in any position in a virtual or mixed reality environment. If you have a static VR/XR simulator setup with a seated, front-facing position, only one lighthouse may sometimes be enough.

When setting up your headset, installing the base stations correctly into your space is highly recommended. A wrong setup could lead to the following:  

Choppy visuals 
Incorrect positional tracking of the headset, leading to breaking the immersion

Please note that Varjo XR-4 Series headsets all have Varjo Controllers and Inside-Out Tracking as standard. For Varjo XR-4 Series, only Steam product variants work with base stations.

Older Varjo headsets work together with SteamVR™ base stations (1.0 or 2.0, which are recommended) manufactured by Valve. They can be purchased directly from the Varjo store.

XR-4 and XR-4 Focal Edition are available in our web store and through selected Varjo resellers to business customers in nearly 40 countries.

Lockheed Martin and Varjo Demonstrate Next-Gen Immersive Cloud Streaming Technology for Training

Lockheed Martin is one of the early adopters of Varjo’s high-fidelity VR/XR cloud streaming solution Varjo Reality Cloud, enabling them to experiment with new ways to scale up the distribution and management of their immersive training applications.

As part of a unique collaboration, Lockheed Martin and Varjo have been able to demonstrate cloud streaming technology as a means of ushering in a whole new era of efficiency for cross-organisational VR and XR simulation deployment. 

Leading aerospace, defence, and advanced technology corporation Lockheed Martin and Varjo share a successful history of collaboration, dating back to the inception of Varjo. The long-standing relationship has enabled the companies to collaborate on various innovative solutions to better serve customers in the training and simulation space.

Lockheed Martin is now one of the early pioneers in adopting the Varjo Reality Cloud, Varjo’s new immersive streaming technology for distributing advanced virtual and mixed reality content.

Pioneering the future of cloud-based training

When discussing the ongoing work with Varjo Reality Cloud, Nigel Jones, Chief Systems Architect at Lockheed Martin, describes the cloud as the way of the future and Lockheed Martin is excited to be at the forefront of this technology. The ability to scale up to match the levels of training that their customers require is a critical priority for Lockheed Martin.

“Varjo were one of the early adopters of this kind of technology and it’s proven to be very useful for us to be able to evaluate what the capability could actually do,” says Jones. “We’re keen to experiment further and see where we can take it in terms of training capability.”

Varjo Reality Cloud enables immersive users to collaborate with ease, share immersive content in up to human-eye resolution, and streamline training workflows. With Varjo Reality Cloud, training and simulation providers can create and share training scenarios, allowing trainees to experience realistic simulations in a readily accessible, controlled environment. The cloud makes it easy to share, and experience these types of simulations in high resolution and with minimal hardware requirements, making them accessible to professionals in all skill levels and circumstances.

Expanding deployment and unlocking access to VR/XR training

Lockheed Martin’s Unreal Engine -based XR training demonstration, showcased at I/ITSEC 2022, utilized a custom Varjo Reality Cloud configuration to remotely manage heavy rendering loads.

This setup enables the use of the professional grade Varjoheadset tethered to a relatively low-cost laptop, which is a major step down in cost from the usual high-end workstations required to power professional grade VR and XR content. This reduction in hardware requirements could allow Lockheed Martin to greatly increase the deployment scope of highly demanding professional simulations. The ability to centralize content management and compute power and use more affordable, smaller footprint devices holds potential for major cost savings.

“For a customer having to buy lots of high-end PCs to distribute widely around their training sites is not an attractive business model. If you can reduce the harbor requirements of your deployed systems, you can save money,” says Jones. “And the ability to centralize your computing power and use far thinner clients is very attractive from a business and price perspective.”

Streamlined solution for sharing and managing VR/XR content at scale

Key benefits of Varjo Reality Cloud for training and simulation:

Streamlined way of delivering software and applications to users at an individual, or organisation-wide, scale
Ability to manage software versions, configurations, and updates more efficiently
Reduced costs from driving down the system requirements for local hardware procurement and maintenance

Varjo Reality Cloud streamlines the management and distribution of VR/XR content across entire teams, offering an effortless means of delivering training simulations to Lockheed Martin’s trainees in any location. Unlike conventional high-end simulators that are typically static and confined to barracks or fixed locations, the cloud overcomes this limitation by providing an easily deployable and user-friendly experience for trainees regardless of their location.

“VR allows us to transition our common software baseline into a different means of delivery, so it is very easy to take a VR headset and a PC and use that on a deployed exercise,” Jones explains. Moreover, Varjo Reality Cloud offers additional benefits for Lockheed Martin as a simulations provider, offering them additional tools for distributing software versions from a central source and controlling their use.

“The cloud provides us with the means of managing the configuration of our software a lot more efficiently. If I can distribute to user sites from a central source and control what versions they’re using, for me, that is obviously an attractive way of delivering software and applications to the user.”

Varjo Reality Cloud is the industry’s only out-of-the-box streaming solution that can handle low latency VR and XR experiences in up to human eye resolution.

VR, AR, XR – Which technology to choose?

The main difference between augmented reality, virtual reality vs mixed reality is the following:

Virtual reality (VR) means entirely replacing the reality a user sees around them with computer-generated 3D content.
Augmented reality (AR) means that the user is experiencing the real reality while (typically translucent) virtual elements are projected onto it.
Mixed reality (MR or XR) means that virtual content is blended with the real world in an interactive, immersive way, and virtual objects appear as a natural part of the real world, occluding behind real objects.

When choosing between augmented, virtual vs mixed reality, take the following factors into consideration.

In VR, a user is completely immersed in the virtual simulation and cut off from the real world. The best-fit use cases are ones where you want a user to experience a completely simulated environment, e.g. training and simulation, architecture, or immersive entertainment. It is also a good fit for many kinds of research or classroom training where the student can remain seated and doesn’t need to move around. VR headsets are typically cheaper than AR and XR headsets.
Most AR devices are optical see-through glasses that create holographic images to float in front of a user’s eyes in a narrow window. The image is translucent because optical see-through devices can’t display black or opaque content. What AR glasses lack in visual detail, they make up for in portability and lightweight. They can be worn outdoors in the field for use cases like maintenance or engineering work. Outside of glasses, AR is also used in smartphone applications, but there the field of view and immersion are limited. These kinds of simple solutions can work great in e.g. games or entertainment.

Mixed reality (MR/XR) combines the best aspects of both VR and AR. In Mixed Reality, virtual objects appear as a natural part of the real world, which is best achieved through video pass-through. The natural interaction between real and virtual enables many applications that are not possible with VR or AR. XR headsets are typically more expensive and need fairly powerful computers to run. As users can interact with both virtual and real worlds and objects, mixed reality is well suited for high-end training and simulation, design and engineering, research, and many other use cases.

How FORCE Technology Achieves a Thousandfold Cost Reduction in Maritime Training with Virtual Reality & Mixed Reality 

FORCE Technology is bringing about a second generational shift in maritime training with the help of Varjo’s virtual and mixed reality.

Key benefits of virtual and mixed reality for maritime training:

Up to a thousandfold cost reduction in operating costs compared to traditional maritime simulators 
Added sense of depth and the ability to realistically perceive distances 
Added portability enables training much closer to the point of need 
High level of immersion in lifelike training scenarios 
Ability to train maritime workforce at scale

Overcoming challenges with innovative training solutions

 When simulators first appeared on the maritime training scene, they represented a generational shift in training capability. They are now essential in training people to pilot commercial marine vessels such as cargo ships. Simulators have many benefits over training with actual vessels: you can practice maneuvers that are hard or impossible to train with real vessels, the operating expense is much lower due, and you can easily implement different weather conditions, for example.  

While these traditional simulator solutions still have a place in the training process, they are not without drawbacks. They typically cost around 1-10 million dollars per unit, they need large facilities, and the portability is practically nonexistent, so training volumes and cost savings are limited. 

A global shortage of skilled seafarers and ship pilots also limits the training of new operators. Many shipping companies can’t afford to commit their existing skilled workforce to training new employees because they are constantly needed to operate the vessels. To combat this shortage, more scalable and cost-effective training solutions that can be deployed closer to the point of need are required.  

VR and XR bring about a generational shift in maritime training 

FORCE Technology is a global leader in the maritime simulation space. They have decades of experience in building bleeding-edge simulators to train employees for the biggest naval companies in the world. They offer several cutting-edge ship bridge simulator models and are always looking to advance the training technology further. This led them to partner with Varjo to explore how the next generation of naval simulation could be built. 

As FORCE Technology’s simulator visual system had already been converted into Unity 3D engine, it enabled an easy integration into a 3D virtual reality environment and from there to Varjo headsets.  

The compatibility of the existing software with Varjo headsets has been a major benefit for the company. As many clients are already familiar with the existing software, using it in this new virtual environment is a frictionless experience.  

“The advantages are clear, and the industry-leading visual quality of Varjo headsets make them the perfect fit for our needs.”

 -
 Director of Department, Simulation, Ports & Training, Force Technology 

“Our headset-based training solution represents a generational evolution in maritime training. I believe this will become the industry gold standard in the future,” says Jan Michelsen, Director of Department, Simulation, Ports & Training at FORCE Technology.

The first major benefit of this evolution has been the cost. Traditional full-scale maritime simulators typically cost around 1-10 million dollars, and the operational costs can add up when factoring in facility expenses, maintenance, and operating the system over time. If you compare this setup to a VR/XR headset-based solution that can be used with a single gaming PC, consumes much less power, and has a total system cost of some tens of thousands of dollars, its advantages for many use cases are clear. The cost reduction can be up to a thousandfold. This technology opens up new markets that were previously unattainable, allowing FORCE Technology to expand its business in exciting new ways.

As the headset-based simulator only requires a single desktop computer, you can use it anywhere you can place that single computer. The added portability enables training much closer to the point of need – without the need for a dedicated simulator facility.  

In the future, Michelsen sees that simulators using Varjo headsets will be deployed directly on ships that are in operation: “This will enable ship crews to practice anchoring at busy or difficult locations en route before they arrive, or train new employees during downtime at ports – right at the bridge where they will be working anyway.” 

Major training quality benefits 

“We’ve researched using VR for maritime training for years, but weren’t able to use it because the technology out there just wasn’t good enough.

Headsets were bulky, the visual quality was not good, there was too much heat emitted, people got cyber sickness, etc. With Varjo, all of those pain points have been solved, and we’ve finally been able to take the next step.”

– Jan Michelsen, Director of Department, Simulation, Ports & Training, FORCE Technology 

But how do headset-based simulators compare to more traditional simulators? One strength of headsets is the added sense of depth and the ability to perceive distances realistically. This is extremely crucial for ship pilot training as vessels are large and slow to maneuver. You need to be able to accurately gauge distances to other vessels in order to avoid collisions and maintain safe distances. 

There is also a stronger sense of immersion, which helps make the training more effective. The added sense of depth and distances is one factor in developing immersion, but it also helps that there are no barriers or cutoff points, which are present when using 2D screens. On a headset, the person is fully immersed, no matter where they look, and there are no cutoff points.  

In order to achieve this kind of immersion, the visual quality has to be sufficient. FORCE Technology tried a few other headsets in addition to Varjo’s offering but found that the visual quality was simply not sufficient. This made Varjo the only choice to suit their needs, and the immersion achieved has been impressive. For example, in tests with clients, Jan Michelsen has seen that after about 10-15 minutes, peoples’ sense that they are in a simulator disappears, and they start behaving as if they were on an actual ship. 

FORCE Technology is now looking to deploy the technology more broadly with numerous customers. Jan Michelsen sees that the future of headset-based training in the maritime industry is bright.

“Our headset-based training solution represents a generational evolution in maritime training. I firmly believe this will become the industry gold standard in the future.”

Virtual Reality

Virtual reality means entirely replacing the reality you see around you with computer-generated 3D content. With head-mounted displays for VR, also known as virtual reality headsets, you’re completely immersed in the virtual simulation and cut off from the real world. This allows you to freely customize and create as many different experiences and scenarios as needed and, depending on the device, you can interact with virtual content and objects using your hands or your eyes.

VR headsets can be tethered to a PC, enabling more powerful graphics. Alternatively, VR headsets can be untethered, which lowers the visual quality but allows the user to move around freely without wires. The virtual experience that you see can be anything between a photogrammetric capture of your actual reality or a computer-generated scene that is 3D modeled and built with a gaming engine.

While VR headsets can provide immersive experiences, they also place limitations on the space where the headset is used as the user’s ability to interact with real-world objects is limited. Collaboration with your (physical) colleagues is also limited, as communicating with them and using devices in the same shared space is difficult. Mixed reality solves these caveats, and with video pass-through-based XR solutions, the devices can be used to navigate between full VR, real-world view, and a mixed reality mode where virtual and real elements blend together seamlessly.

Field of View in VR / XR

Field of view refers to the amount (width) of the observable virtual world that you can see at one point in time when using VR/AR/XR headsets. The wider the field of view (or FOV), the more you can experience without having to turn your head. FOV is usually measured in degrees. For example, Varjo XR-4 Series headsets all offer a horizontal field of view of 120°, which almost matches the FOV of the human eye (135°)

Varjo Aero headset offers a 115° field of view (horizontal). A wide FOV is critical in creating a realistic experience inside a headset.

In augmented reality devices, especially when based on optical see-through technology, the field of view for the AR content is often narrow. Most AR glasses can only portray virtual content within a certain segment of the user’s overall FOV, for instance only for 30 or 40 degrees. For video pass-through-based mixed reality devices, virtual and mixed reality content can be portrayed across the full FOV of the user. This enhances overall immersion.

This image illustrates the FOV of Varjo XR-3 headset compared to optical-see-through based AR glasses. In mixed reality devices that are based on video pass-through technology, virtual content can be portrayed across the full vision field.

Operating Drones in Mixed Reality: How Inzpire Leverages Varjo for Next-Gen UAV Training 

Inzpire’s compact, agile, synthetic environment system provides highly realistic UAV training scenarios directly to the front lines, adapting to the ever-changing modern day operational environments.

Expanding the Scope of Drone Operations

The use of drones in defence and security operations has become increasingly vital. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are used for various tasks such as aerial monitoring, surveillance, and reconnaissance. These operations are crucial for modern defence strategy as they provide a high level of situational awareness, reduce the risk to human life, and can be conducted in a variety of environments without direct human presence. 

The use of medium and small UAVs has surged in importance during the recent years, and so has the demand for precise, effective training for drone operators. 

Setting New Standards in Simulation Technology

Founded in United Kingdom, Inzpire Limited is a training provider consisting of numerous divisions and subject matter experts across all areas of defence. The company is at the forefront of developing groundbreaking synthetic environments and simulation technologies aimed to enhance the training capabilities for a variety of defence operations. 

Inzpire is one of the first training providers to integrate an UAV ground control station with a virtual battlespace simulation, all while utilizing a mixed reality headset as the trainer’s display. Inzpire’s compact, agile, synthetic environment (CASE) system, coupled with Varjo’s industry-leading mixed reality technology, provides a unique solution that allows for highly realistic immersive drone operator training. 

This compact system is designed to be deployable at the point of need, whether in the field or in a classroom. It can operate as a standalone system or be linked with multiple systems to provide comprehensive training.

Mastering the Skies with Advanced Immersive Training

By putting on the Varjo headset, Inzpire’s trainees are transferred into a realistic virtual battle space environment where they utilize a ground control station to navigate the user interface and have access to their real-world equipment. They can practice anything from type-specific flying techniques to error handling and emergency responses in the immersive mixed reality setting. The experience allows them to learn not only how to operate the equipment but also how to manage the payload, including cameras and sensor systems, all within a virtual environment that responds just like the real world. 

This type of training is invaluable, whether it’s for pre-deployment preparation, initial training, or ongoing proficiency training to maintain their operational skills. 

“Using Varjo’s technology has allowed us to achieve seamless integration between the live and the virtual. For students, this means that they can do procedures and tactics training all in the same environment, and it immerses them and enhances the believability,” says , Engineering Lead for Mission Training Devices at Inzpire.

“Using Varjo’s technology has allowed us to achieve seamless integration between the live and the virtual.”

James Clarkson

 Engineering Lead for Mission Training Devices at Inzpire

A New Dimension in Training Effectiveness

Mixed reality introduces a transformative dimension to simulation systems by enabling the blending of live real-life pass-through video with virtual environments or objects. In Inzpire’s solution, this integration allows users to see their own hands, utilize their equipment, and employ planning tools, such as maps, within the simulation, all while using the ground control station that operates the UAVs. Mixed reality also allows the trainees to pass information and communicate with each other effectively during the simulation. 

“The introduction of mixed reality is a game changer. Mixed reality is now the forefront of immersive technology because it accurately matches the virtual and the real-world environment, which is extremely important,” Clarkson notes. 

Mixed reality adds to the level of immersion of the simulation, and as a result, the training becomes more operationally valid and effective, rather than users treating the simulation as a consequence-free environment.

“Trainees actually believe that what they’re doing is increasingly important and they’ll take greater care and therefore it’s more operationally valid.” 

 “If you’re immersed in an environment, you forget that you’re wearing a headset. You forget that you’re in a training room or a training tent. You believe you’re in the field and you believe what you’re doing is part of your training and it’s part of your environment,” Clarkson says. 

Elevating Situational Awareness with High-Resolution Clarity 

One of the key benefits of Inzpire’s training system is the user’s ability to clearly see objects at varying distances. The high-resolution displays of the Varjo headsets ensure that trainees can effectively identify and interact with elements, such as helicopters, aerial assets, vehicles, or troops, in the virtual environment, enhancing their situational awareness and operational effectiveness. “Having used virtual reality for about 20 years, the switch to a Varjo headset marked a significant improvement due to its superior quality and clarity,” Clarkson shares.  

The Varjo XR-4 Focal Edition takes this a step further, as users will be able to read all text and data clearly regardless of where they are looking, thanks to the XR-4 Focal Edition’s industry-first gaze-directed autofocus system.

“The XR-4 is generating considerable excitement for us, because of its advancements in the focal range mixed reality camera technology, improvements in display resolution, and ergonomic enhancements,” says Clarkson. 

Preparing UAV Crews Across the World

Inzpire’s training solution is designed to be deployable directly in the field, allowing UAV crews to complete their training without the need to return home. Instead, they can complete their mission planning, mission rehearsal, and training anywhere in the world. This on-the-spot training capability ensures that training is available precisely when and where it’s needed. 

“With the growing importance of accurate and effective training, and as the operation environments are changing rapidly, our solution meets these demands by being inherently deployable to the front lines,” Clarkson states.

Latency in virtual reality (VR) and mixed reality (XR)

Low latency is extremely important for mixed, augmented, and virtual reality content. The main reasons why lower latency is better are the elimination of cybersickness and achieving a deeper immersion.

As a person moves their head, a headset should display the resulting changes almost immediately. If there is a significant delay, the user’s brain will reject the virtual world, causing them to lose immersion. This can, in turn, cause nausea and reduce the effectiveness of learning outcomes, for example.

In research, a meaningful latency threshold for virtual and mixed reality has been determined to be around 20 milliseconds. While humans can detect very small relative delays in parts of the visual field, when absolute delays are below approximately 20 milliseconds, they are generally imperceptible. Going below this threshold eliminates a major cause of cybersickness and achieves much deeper immersion, especially when combined with high resolution.

Achieving this is somewhat easier in virtual reality, where the user is shut out from the real world and only sees digital content. It is much more challenging in mixed reality. Mixed reality using video pass-through uses cameras to digitize the world in real-time. That data is then combined with virtual content inside our GPU and shown to users through the mixed reality device – completely blurring the lines between real and virtual. where digital objects blend with the real world, and the digital content needs to react to the real world fast enough so immersion does not break.
