Founded in 2017, Ignite Outage Group LLC is made up of a team of experts across multiple disciplines such as gas turbines, steam turbines, and generators. The company offers technical and engineering services for the Heavy Duty Commercial, Utility, and Industrial Energy sectors. As the detection of gas leaks is a crucial element for services such as commissioning and outage planning, Ignite counted on Distran’s Ultrasonic Camera at a combined cycle power plant (CCCP) located in the USA. The 827 MW plant consists of three combined cycle units with separated dry Air-Cooled Condensers (ACC).

How to detect leaks without interfering with plant operations?

Leaks due to cracks and cuts, e.g. on the ACC, downgrade performance. The traditional leak inspection method at the American 827 MW CCCP, i.e. by spraying helium around the relevant areas in combination with a downstream sensor, entailed various issues. Hence, Ignite set out to find a new solution enabling them to:

REDUCE THE EXPOSURE TO HOT AREAS

INCREASE THE PRECISION OF LEAK LOCALIZATION

DECREASE THE REQUIRED EXPERT KNOW-HOW

Different from traditional gas leak detection technologies such as soap spray, sniffers, or infrared cameras, Distran Ultrasonic Cameras (learn more about Ultra Pro and Ultra Pro X in the Products section) harness Acoustic Leak Imaging (ALI), i.e. use ultrasounds to detect leaks of all gas types from safe distances.

High pressure for high performance

Equipped with a Distran Ultrasonic Camera, the team in charge inspected the plant’s three condenser systems. As the vacuum pressures are essential to protect the steam turbines and maintain performance, they focused on detecting atmospheric air leaks into the condenser system negatively impacting the vacuum pressure.

The two-day survey took place during regular plant operation and resulted in findings:

8 vacuum leaks on the ACC.
5 vacuum leaks on the compensator.
2 steam leaks on the low-pressure steam turbine casing.
11 compressed air leaks.

With Audalytics, Distran’s integrated reporting tool, the team in charge created a report including all findings documented in real-time with pictures, videos, and voice recordings.

Based on this report, the plant operator prioritized and scheduled the necessary repairs for the next regular shutdown.

Vacuum performance to ensure power plant availability

The Distran Ultra Pro enabled the operator of a UK-based power plant to detect and pinpoint a 7.5 mbar vacuum loss on the condenser system.

This vacuum loss caused a decrease in production estimated to 7,862 MWh over a six-month period, equivalent to a 1 500 000 USD loss
(approx. 1 384 000 €).

Both a technical and economic impact

The inspection with the Distran Ultrasonic Camera took much less time compared to the previous approach. Additionally, the team in charge covered larger areas, found leaks from safe distances, and gathered more data.

As explained here, the detection of vacuum leaks can have a strong technical and economic impact:

A 0.35 inches Hg (12 mbar) average improvement in condenser vacuum can lead to a 30-70 Btu/kWh heat rate improvement.
This can result in annual fuel, operations, and maintenance savings of up to 100 000 USD for an 827-MW CCCP.

By making ladder climbing, elevating platforms, or entering hot spaces obsolete, Distran Ultrasonic Cameras empower plant operators to maintain performance without interfering with plant operations. A couple of minutes of walking through and scanning an area with the easy-to-use device is sufficient to spot leaks, saving hours of inspection time compared to traditional tools.
