Why do gas leaks produce ultrasounds?

Many physical processes, such as gas leaks, partial discharges or mechanical defects, create acoustic emissions (AE). Ultrasounds are often the first indication that an element is starting to fail, well before heat/infrared emissions (if any).

How does ultrasound imaging work

From sounds to images

The surface of Ultra Pro is composed of dozens of sensors that measure the sound field. When an ultrasound wave hits the surface, each sensor detects it at a different time. These differences are used to locate the ultrasound sources and overlay their location on to a video image. Ultra Pro takes into account an unlimited number of sources simultaneously.

Quantification of gas leak rate

From sounds to gas leak rate

In addition to locating the leak, Ultra Pro is able to estimate the flow escaping through a leak in liters per hour, based on the acoustic emission strength and the pressure difference at the leak. This allows the user to quickly asses the severity and the cost associated with the leak. Furthermore, the smallest detectable leak in the current environment is automatically displayed in real-time (patent pending).
