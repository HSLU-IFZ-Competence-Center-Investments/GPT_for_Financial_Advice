 at Distran

Pioneering Acoustic Leak Imaging (ALI), Distran Ultrasonic Cameras are acoustic imaging cameras that pinpoint leaks of any type of gas from far distances, without contact with the gas, and in unexpected locations. Inspection times are up to 10 times shorter than with other techniques.

Based on the combination of an integrated microphone array with an optical camera, the easy-to-use devices capture sounds emitted by gas leaks in the ultrasound frequency range and show the accurate locations of the leaks. They detect leaks as small as 0.1 ft3/ h for a 58-psi methane leak at a 1-ft distance and enable real-time leak rate quantification.

After having invented the world’s first ultrasonic camera in 2013, Distran was founded the same year. Customers such as Shell, ExxonMobil, and TotalEnergies count on us for gas leak detection. Headquartered in Switzerland, we also have offices in Germany, France, Denmark, the USA, India, Singapore, and Bahrain as well as a broad network of distributors.
