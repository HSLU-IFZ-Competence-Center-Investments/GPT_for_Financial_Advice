Osteoporosis has emerged as a major health concern in almost all industrialized countries.

Osteoporosis is a condition that can often go undetected until a fracture occurs. When left untreated, it can lead not only to significant pain but disability, and loss of independence.

30% of osteopenic patients are about the same risk of fracture as some of those who are osteoporotic and are potentially missed by bone densitometry alone (1). You need additional information about your bone quality. This can be assessed by Trabecular Bone Score.

Why is TBS important to measure?

While BMD is currently the gold standard for the diagnosis of osteoporosis, it has its limitations since it only provides information on bone quantity. Unlike BMD, Trabecular Bone Score provides useful additional clinical information on bone microarchitecture. TBS Osteo provides a more comprehensive overview of your bone health.

Trabecular Bone Score can be obtained from a regular DXA examination. This allows your doctor to better evaluate your bone health for improved patient care.
