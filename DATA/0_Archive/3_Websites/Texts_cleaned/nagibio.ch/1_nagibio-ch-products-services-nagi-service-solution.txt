Nagi Service Solutions

Safety & efficacy testing services

Start your journey today

Bridging the gap between cells and vertebrates with innovative 3Rs testing services

We offer innovative toxicology studies powered by the unique Organism-on-Chip technology and our multidisciplinary team of scientists with more than 30 years of expertise in the field.

Rapid identification of chemical and drug toxicity

Mechanistic toxicity studies
Investigation of adverse outcome pathways

Nagi™ toxicology solutions are performed with our cutting-edge technology that allows the delivery of full-organism data while being conducted at the in vitro scale.

We plan the project with you, forget about the execution. We perform the necessary experiments, collect and analyze the data, and deliver a complete tailor-made report to you.

Speed-up your candidates’ pipeline and boost your lead optimization with readouts that only Nagi™ pioneer technology based on micro-organisms can obtain. 

How do we do our efficacy studies?

We offer in vivo high-content screening of drugs and active compounds on transgenic/mutant C. elegans strains of interest (e.g. C. elegans models for human diseases).

Unlock the potential of small organisms to determine human-relevant toxicity of your pipeline drugs, agrochemicals, chemicals, molecules of interest and more.

datapoints like never before

Get quick and accurate data about the effects of your compounds on living systems. Make predictions about their potential impact on animal and human health.

A Powerful model for powerful readouts

We specialize in using Caenorhabditis elegans (C.elegans) nematodes as a model system to test the safety and efficacy of chemicals and substances.

The trusted partner of researchers

Failure in later stages of the R&D pipeline is especially costly. We actively pursue technologies to identify adverse toxicology as early as possible, such as Nagi Bioscience’s technologies.

Early Toxicology Safety – Agrochemical Company

Unfavorable toxicological profiles are a major cause of late failure in our discovery pipelines. Failure in later stages of the R&D pipeline is especially costly. We are actively pursuing technologies to identify adverse toxicology as early as possible, including through the use of model systems such as those being investigated by Nagi Bioscience.

Methodologies to assess lifespan and healthspan measures in a high-throughput manner are currently inadequate in the C. elegans field. The integration of Nagi’s technology opened many possibilities for us as a company.

CEO – Aging Biotech Company

Before proceeding to clinical trials, the efficacy of our existing drugs or combinations thereof for their positive impact on healthspan will be tested in the nematode C.elegans. However, methodologies to assess lifespan and healthspan measures in a high-throughput manner are currently inadequate in the C. elegans field. The integration of Nagi’s technology into Rejuvenate opened many possibilities for us as a company.
