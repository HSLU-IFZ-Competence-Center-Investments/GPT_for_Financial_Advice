Masters

NILT offers masters and sub-masters with a wide range of structures, and in a wide range of form factors and materials. Our focus is masters for diffractive optical elements, metalenses and augmented/mixed reality. We also have capabilities to create masters for other applications.

The masters are made using electron beam lithography (EBL), deep UV Lithography (DUV) and direct laser writing, combined with advanced dry etching, and deposition processes.

All masters are made to customer specifications. Prior to shipment, all specifications are confirmed by metrology, as scanning electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy and optical microscopy, and reported to the customer.
