Single-surface element allow for extreme miniaturization of optical systems.

NILT both designs and processes these pattern projector elements with the option of building them into full pattern projector modules on demand.

NILT offers single-surface metalens pattern projectors for projection of text, logo, structured light or other applications

Pattern Projection

NILT offers single-surface metalens pattern projectors for applications where a particular projected pattern is desired. This can be anything from an asymmetric diffuser profile to a projected text or logo. If the pattern can be defined as a grey scale image NILT can design the projector to give sharp pattern on a plane or tilted plane.NILT both designs and processes these pattern projector elements with the option of building them into full pattern projector modules on demand.

Advantages
