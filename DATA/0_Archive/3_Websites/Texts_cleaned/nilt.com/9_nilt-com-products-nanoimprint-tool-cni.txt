The Compact Nanoimprint Tool - CNI v3.0 -

Perfect for testing & demos | Compact desktop size | | A cost-effective solution

 Find your CNI configuration 

A desktop nanoimprint tool for easy replication of micro and nanoscale structures

The starting point of nano-replication

A compact nanoimprint tool that can be used for both imprinting and hot embossing. Perfect for testing and demo. 

Versatile and flexible 

Supports masters and substrates up to 120 and 210 mm. Both versions support thermal imprint up to 250°C and UV imprint at 365 nm and/or 405 nm

Replication in a box

Allows for replication of micro- and nanostructures from masters to substrates, both thermal replication and UV replication. 

Ease of use, cost-effective 

Robust and simple to operate. It facilitates non-standard processes and new experiments as well as mature and advanced development

“We have a very special sample set up which differs from standard applications. To process these samples, we were looking for a tool that allowed us to perform nanoimprinting at elevated temperatures and high forces under vacuum conditions. 

We were really happy when we found the CNI tool. It combined all our requirements with an open construction and a flexible nature, enabling us to manipulate our sample setup inside the tool easily.”Enno Schatz, University of Würzburg

CNI-replication in 4-level polymer (device) with steep side walls, sharp corners and low roughness. Polymer coated with Au prior to obtaining SEM.

The SEM image shows a replication we did in collaboration with Johns Hopkins University. This is chromium dots on silicon after lift-off. The pattern was thermal imprinted in the CNI tool using mr-I8000 series resist from MicroResist. The smallest dots are 100 nm diameter.

See the CNI in use 

In this short video, we show the most basic operations in the CNI tool. We use hot embossing to create a working stamp from a master and we use UV nanoimprint to transfer the pattern from the working stamp and onto a silicon wafer with mr-NIL210 UV imprint resist. The CNI used is the CNI v2.1.

We do also have a short user story about multiscale hydrophobic structures using reverse NIL in a CNI.
