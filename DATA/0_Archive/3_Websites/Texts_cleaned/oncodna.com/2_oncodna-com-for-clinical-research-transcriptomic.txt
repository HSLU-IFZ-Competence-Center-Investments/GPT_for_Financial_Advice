The transcriptome is comprised of all RNA molecules including mRNA, rRNA, tRNA, and other non-coding RNA transcribed in one cell or a population of cells. OncoDNA is a leading expert in the study of the transcriptome and the measure of RNA expression. 

RNA-Seq uses deep sequencing technologies for transcriptome profiling that provides more precise measurement of levels of transcripts and their isoforms than other methods. OncoDNA is an expert with RNA-Seq and can assist researchers to design and implement a wide variety of RNA-Seq related studies.Experience across a full range of RNA-Seq study types.We also offer clinical grade RNA-Seq for personalized medicine studies.Cutting-edge, constantly updated bioinformatic pipelines.We can provide you with advice on experimental design.from study design through tertiary biostatistical analysis.

We have developed a powerful workflow to access cancer gene expression signatures. Dowload our paper to discover the technical features of our 3’ RNA-seq protocol for accurate gene transcriptomic analysis of challenging tumor samples. 

OncoDNA has developed and streamlined a process for measuring small RNA expression in tissue samples and liquid biopsies (serum or plasma) via next generation sequencing. We offer researchers a small RNA sequencing service for examining gene regulation at both the transcriptional and post-transcriptional level.

We offer a proprietary protocol for small RNA-SEQFully optimized process – from extraction to bioinformatics.Start with either frozen or FFPE tissue, circulating blood cells, or liquid biopsies.Able to extract total RNA from either plasma or serum.Library prep uses random adapters via in-house developed protocolReduces bias representationProvides better correlation.State-of-the-art analysis using snRNAbench mutational signatures. 

OncoDNA is a theranostic and genomic company with renown expertise in precision oncology and genetic diseases.
