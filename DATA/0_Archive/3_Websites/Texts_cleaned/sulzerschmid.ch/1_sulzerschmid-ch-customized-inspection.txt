The Complete Inspection Package for OEMs

Designed to promote efficiency and cost-effectiveness during inspection, our 3DX™ Blade Platform is the ideal choice for OEMs. 

Regular rotor blade inspections form the basis for any professional blade O&M strategy. But how do you increase efficiency without compromising quality? Our integrated inspection system relies on the latest technology to achieve conclusive results in less time than any of the established inspection methods.
A more detailed view of maintenance requirements

The goal is to enable OEMs to issue repair quotes that are based on reliable and detailed data. Automated report generation saves time, and annotations are rated on a scale from cosmetic to serious, so you can optimize resource allocation.

Our 3DX™ Blade Platform facilitates the entire process from planning to damage analysis, significantly cutting the time required for each inspection while simultaneously increasing the quality and repeatability of the results. Not only does this reduce costs, it allows OEMs to solicit accurate repair quotes and work towards predictive maintenance.

A Structured Inspection Process 

for Wind Asset Operators

Striking a balance between aerodynamic performance and blade repair costs while maintaining safety standards is fundamental for wind asset operators. Using the 3DX™ Blade Platform, frequent inspections are now cost-efficient and allow operators to take the first step towards predictive maintenance of rotor blades. 
Keep inspections in check

The 3DX™ Blade Platform simplifies the way wind asset operators examine and manage their blades. Due to the high degree of automation, rotor blade inspections become highly repeatable, generating an inspection plan that can be used again and again for any given wind park. Inspections are quick to set up, require little manpower and can be run frequently.
Using data to predict inspection needs

The 3DX™ Blade Platform enables you to build a record of checks and damages over the lifespan of your blades. The results obtained from each inspection are added to the database, so you can track progress and analyze trends over the long term. This helps you forecast maintenance requirements, implement preventative measures and schedule repairs, giving you better oversight and control of the safety of your assets.

as a Field Operation Partner

Field Operation Partners often have to carry out inspections under intense time and cost constraints. To really stand out, they must use an approach that is tailored to customers’ needs and exceeds expectations.
Higher quality and transparency for your customers

Our autonomous flight components put you in charge: as a UAV operator, now you have the tools to capture every millimeter of a rotor blade – efficiently and consistently, time and again. All flight paths, camera and sensor settings are predefined in advance of an inspection flight by components of our 3DX™ Blade Platform. The quality of the data acquisition no longer relies on the skill and experience of a UAV pilot. In addition, given the throughput of the system, a high level of efficiency is attained, allowing you to take on more inspection contracts.

As a blade repair service partner, the 3DX™ Blade Platform enables you to provide your customers with an unprecedented level of transparency. Using our collaborative software applications you can share data in real time and agree on repair measures based on accurate inspection data.
Deeper expertise as a selling point

Our image analysis tools give you peace of mind: as a blade expert, your customers depend on your judgement. You will appreciate the consistency and quality of the inspection images and the cutting-edge analysis tools, aided by Artificial Intelligence, which will shorten the time you need to assess the image data and produce a detailed damage report, all while adhering to the highest quality standards. Be the go-to resource for all insight on blade damages.
