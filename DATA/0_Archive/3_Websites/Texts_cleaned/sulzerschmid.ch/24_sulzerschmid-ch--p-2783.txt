Whether you prefer in-house control or outsourcing to a reliable third-party provider, our solutions are designed to meet your unique needs.
A Solid Foundation for Blade InspectionsFully autonomous Rotor blade inspections with 3DX AutoPilot

At the core of our end-to-end digital inspection process is the 3DX™ Blade Platform. Repeatable and with consistently high image quality, all our inspections cover 100% of the blade. Images are checked on-site for quality control and automatically transferred to the platform. This transfer is completely seamless and doesn’t utilize third party applications such as drop box etc. After an advanced AI-supported annotation process, in which our dedicated in-house team categorizes and classifies damages, blade experts can review and approve them faster than ever before and decide what action to take. By using different tools and filters in the platform, customers can also analyze fleet wide inspection data and use these blade insights for accurate repair planning and optimization of the wind turbine fleet’s performance.

Whether you choose to inspect with your own team or contract a third-party provider for inspections, the platform and the process is the same.
