Note about laptop graphics cards

Laptop graphics cards with identical names can perform differently depending on factors such as the thermal design of the laptop and amount of memory on the card.

Some key terms to keep in mind when comparing graphics cards:

Total Graphics Power (TGP): The maximum power consumption of a graphics card, which gives an indication of its maximum performance.
GPU memory: Graphics cards come in many variants with different amounts of memory on the card, which also affects performance.

These are the hardware requirements when using Varjo Aero with a laptop computer:

Processor (CPU)
High-end mobile CPU with 4 cores or more

Graphics card (GPU)1
High-end NVIDIA Ada generation laptop GPU with a Total Graphics Power (TGP) of 115W or more:

NVIDIA Geforce RTX 3080 Laptop GPU
NVIDIA RTX A5000 Laptop GPU

Connectivity

1 x Mini DisplayPort port

Note that the adapter must support 8k video and DisplayPort 1.4 with Display Stream Compression (DSC). See a list of tested and compatible adapters.
