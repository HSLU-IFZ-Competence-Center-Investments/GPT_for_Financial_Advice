Sustainable pest control
The power of early detection

Underpinning Anticimex' ability to have a positive impact on the environment is early detection and a unique methodology to identify – and treat – the root cause. Through innovation combining digital capabilities and biological and entomological expertise, Anticimex is driving the transformation from reactive to preventive pest control services. 
24/7 real-time monitoring
The most resource efficient and effective pest control

Anticimex’ SMART solutions support 24/7 real-time monitoring which enables early detection and the detective work necessary to identify pest movement. Together with sophisticated risk assessments and thorough securing of premises, this is a fundamental aspect in achieving resource efficient and effective pest control.
Why does early detection matter?

Rodents reproduce fast. They reach sexual maturity within 40 days and can yearly carry 5-7 litters of up to 10 rats. This means that – undetected – a single pair of rats can reproduce to more than 1.000 rats in a year. 

Another pest with a high potential of becoming a problem is cockroaches. Most of them are nocturnal and might go unnoticed for a long time and they also hide away their offspring in a hard cased egg sac – ootheca - containing up to 40 small cockroaches, called nymphs. 

Early detection is critically important, since it circumvents excessive usage of pesticides, equipment and other resources – and minimizes damage and contamination caused by the various pests.
Benefits of SMART methodology– illustrated

As depicted in the figure above, Anticimex’ SMART solution supports early detection of pest infestations, with quick identification of root cause, and often immediate and non-toxic remediation. Conversely, using a traditional approach means that a pest infestation is detected at a later stage, and consequently the pest population can grow a lot before traps and pesticides are applied. The traditional method requires physical visits to check status and perform re-baiting and emptying traps, meaning that several visits to the customer premise are required before the pest issue can finally be resolved.

Through SMART-enabled early detection, Anticimex is a key contributor in protecting biodiversity and reducing food and property waste – as well as the risk of pest borne disease – by means of a sustainable, economical and resource efficient approach.More about Anticimex SMART

Vision, strategy, business model

Anticimex vision is to become the global leader in the preventive pest control market, which the Group defines as pest control activities focused on preventing pest occurrence before they appear and early treatment methods to limit damage, as opposed to activities meant to primarily treat an active pest problem. 

PeiAnticimex aims to achieve leadership in the areas of innovation, quality of service offering and customer service, as opposed to on the basis of market share, market position or revenue relative to other global pest control companies.

The strategy to achieve this leadership position is focused on four main concepts: increasing the quality and efficiency of its service offering, improving the Group’s pricing models, developing the SMART service offerings and continuing growth through acquisitions.

The Anticimex Model has five key components, as set out below, and is focused on a decentralized branch-based structure that emphasizes the performance and initiative of individual branches. From an operational perspective, the Group considers its operations in each country other than the United States as a separate platform. In the United States, the Group operates multiple platforms because the country represents a significant part of the global pest control market and organizing its operations into multiple platforms allows the Group to maintain a local focus and stay close to its customers. Each platform is managed by a “Platform President”. Within each platform, Anticimex has several branches, each managed by a branch manager.

The Anticimex Model is centered around the key principle that the branch managers have the closest knowledge of the local market, including the customers, competition and other market dynamics. This is reflected in each aspect of the Group’s business, including its offering, services delivery, and its acquisition processes. The Anticimex Model is supported by the Group’s HQ function, which provides support across key areas such as complex acquisition matters, SMART product development, performance monitoring and the sharing of best practices.

Anticimex in the World Mobile Congress - WMC 2024
News

Barcelona, Spain, March 6, 2024 – Anticimex, a global leader in pest management solutions, left a lasting impression at the recent Mobile World Congress (MWC) 2024 held in Barcelona. The event, which took place on February 27th, serves as the premier gathering place for the mobile communications industry.

Anticimex had a remarkable presence at the last edition of the Mobile World Congress, MWC 2024, held in Barcelona on February 27th.

Peter Hohnen, Head of Research, Partnerships & IP, joined as a speaker at the Telenor booth. Telenor is Anticimex's partner for IoT (Internet of Things) technology integrated into SMART solutions. During his presentation, he talked about how Anticimex has disrupted pest control services with SMART, an intelligent system that allows constant monitoring and instantly reacting; it prevents costly infestations in an environmentally friendly way.

Mr. Hohnen also addressed how the Anticimex approach deals with the root cause rather than the symptoms by getting the data from the devices, processing it, and analyzing the data points. Then, turning data into actionable insights, he added, "We know where and why the infestation happened and can thus take preventive measures. The system gets more and more trained to be able to predict and recommend better to our customers".

About the Mobile World Congress

The Mobile World Congress (MWC), also known as MWC Barcelona, is an annual trade show dedicated to the mobile communications industry. It's considered the largest and most influential event in this domain, bringing together industry leaders, professionals, and enthusiasts.

htmlSustainability impact areas - AnticimexMarketsSearchAbout Anticimex SMARTAround the worldSustainabilityContactMarketsSearchHomeSustainabilitySustainability impact areas
Sustainability impact areas
Positively impacting the world we operate in

At the core of the sustainability strategy sit three key environmental impact areas that are fundamental to Anticimex’ contribution towards a more sustainable world. These impact areas are geared at protecting biodiversity, preventing pest borne diseases, and reducing property loss and food waste. Anticimex is uniquely positioned to have a positive impact in these areas through its SMART enabled, proactive pest control methodology.
Aligned with UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)

Anticimex's dedication to sustainability is deeply rooted in the core of its operations. The company firmly believes that by upholding these sustainable impact areas and aligning itself with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), it can foster a positive and enduring impact on the environment, society, and future generations. This commitment strengthens Anticimex's resolve to shape a better future through responsible practices and solutions.

Invasive pests pose a major challenge to biodiversity, and the economic damage that they cause exceeds 5% of the global gross product. When pests enter a new area, they often arrive without natural enemies and the population can explode without anything standing in the way, which can push out native species and upset the balance of unique ecosystems. Here pest control contributes to protecting biodiversity and the local ecosystem, particularly consider ing trends like increased travel, globalization and climate change.

Usage of biocides to battle pest poses another challenge to biodiversity. If overused or misused it risks spreading into freshwater, or causing unintentional poisoning by consumption, either directly or through the food chain. Hence, using biocides more effectively, with early detection and non-tox alternatives, becomes essential to minimize potential harm on the environment.
Prevent the spreading of pest borne diseases

Human health is threatened by pest and animals carrying harmful germs that can spread to people and cause illness. In fact, scientists estimate that more than six out of every ten known infectious diseases in people are spread from pest and animals, and three out of every four new or emerging infectious diseases in people come from animals. Perhaps the most well-known example is the bubonic plague, which spread through rodents carrying infected fleas. 

Controlling pests – in particular detecting issues earlier and treating the root cause in a preventive manner – reduces the risk of severe and harmful pest infestations.
Reduce property loss and food waste

Pests that eat grains are contaminating food processing chains – causing significant food loss worldwide, every year. Rodents also cause damages to production lines and goods, forcing production stoppages, replacement of parts and discarding of products. This increases production and consumption – and consequently emissions – that could have been avoided. 

Detecting and combating pests early leads to less contamination and damage in the value chain.

In addition to the above-mentioned environmental impact areas, Anticimex’ sustainability strategy also encompasses approaches to minimize CO2 emissions from the vehicle fleet, by continuously performing route optimizations and transitioning towards electrical vehicles.

Furthermore, as Anticimex relies heavily on having competent and engaged personnel in all parts of the organization, the sustainability strategy also includes focus areas to ensure that Anticimex stays a preferred employer, while also providing a safe and healthy workplace, worldwide.

Anticimex’ sustainability work is linked to the UN Sustainable Development Goals, and governance of Anticimex’ sustainability efforts is mainly regulatedby the company’s Code of Conduct, which has been established by the Board of Directors. To further strengthen compliance with the Code of Conduct, a direct link to corporate management has been established, the SpeakUp Line, which can be used by everybody in the company to report potential breaches.

10_ANTICIMEX-COM-PEST-CONTROL-MARKE

html - AnticimexMarketsSearchAbout Anticimex SMARTAround the worldSustainabilityContactMarketsSearchHomePest control
Pest control

Pest control refers to the identification, control and elimination of pests. Services include both proactive and reactive activities, such as inspecting premises on a regular basis and reporting findings, advising customers on preventative measures or suitable methods of treatment using pest control equipment or biocides, animal and wildlife removal or other treatment options. 

Services may be performed physically by pest control technicians or remotely through services leveraging new technology, such as Anticimex’s SMART solution, which uses intelligent traps and sensors, data analytics and biology knowledge to prevent and control rodent activity.

The digitally-enabled pest control market is a subset of the pest control market where pest control providers use traps and sensors that are connected to the internet and continuously monitored, and report events and status in order to be able to act fast and potentially at a stage prior to infestation. Anticimex provides digitally-enabled pest control services using monitored traps and sensors that eliminate pests mechanically and/or electrically without the use of biocides. The market definition may also include solutions where, for example, monitoring sensors are placed in traps that use biocides as bait in order to track pest activity and trigger a notification if a pest enters a trap.

Pest control services are offered to commercial customers, including hotels and restaurants, grocery stores, public services, manufacturing and/or industry, and residential customers. The most common pest types are rodents, termites, insects, and wildlife (e.g., birds, snakes, and spiders).

SMART – Digital pest control
Protect your business 24/7 with digital pest control

Anticimex SMART is an intelligent system that keeps an eye on things you don't want to see. By constantly monitoring and instantly reacting, it prevents costly infestations in an environmentally-friendly way. Add the services traditionally provided by us, and you will get a solution that gives you the best of two worlds - automation and expertise.

How it works
1. We analyze and plan

First we inspect your site, study available documentation and interview key persons. Based on what we discover, we define the optimal solution for your business. If there’s already an infestation taking place, we take care of it.
2. We install and connect

Based on our plan, we install a system of strategically placed sensors that detect infestations and non-toxic traps that efficiently deal with pests. The Smart units are connected and constantly report back to our Smart data hub.
3. We service, you relax

We conduct regular inspections, empty and relocate traps when needed, analyze data and provide you with necessary information. Once any activity is reported we proceed to act immediately so you can focus your attention elsewhere.
The Anticimex SMART method - watch why it works

Instead of focusing on symptoms, the Anticimex SMART method is solving the root cause. With constant monitoring and instant response time, SMART protects your business 24/7 and prevents costly damages in a sustainable and non-toxic way. Watch the video below lo learn more about how it works:
Benefits
Around the clock surveillance

Anticimex pest solutions today depend on quarterly or monthly physical inspections. Anticimex SMART, on the other hand, monitors constantly, reacts instantly and reports directly.

All Anticimex SMART traps are 100% non-toxic. It’s better for the environment, it creates a healthier work environment and it means no pesticides ending up where they aren’t supposed to be.

Solving an infestation takes time, and the damage done to your business can be substantial. With Anticimex SMART installed, we can act fast on early warnings and deal with potential issues before they turn into costly problems.

Pests excel at hiding in places where they are hard to detect. With Anticimex SMART and our innovative sensors we can detect activities in hidden places or relocate traps to that specific area.

Anticimex SMART is an intelligent system connected to our Smart data hub, which allows us to analyze your situation and, when needed, export the data you need to present your status to an external part.

Sustainability
Pest control is a sustainability driver

Professional pest control is an essential service and responsible for the protection of public health, food and property. Society can´t afford to have medical facilities, groceries stores, industries or homes uninhabitable due to pest related damages and diseases. That's why pest control is needed to mitigate the risk of invasive species and protect the natural balance in the environment, which is under growing risk due to globalization and modern society. Pest control is therefore a sustainability driver in itself, but Anticimex is taking it to the next level.
Transforming the industry to sustainable pest control

Anticimex SMART pest control is taking industry sustainability to a whole new level. It is a key enabler for early detection and offers fast – often immediate and non-toxic – remediation. Together with risk assessment and securing of premises, Anticimex' SMART offerings the industry from reactive to preventive, by offering a more effective pest control solution for its clients and contributing to a more sustainable world.Discover how

In the pursuit of a sustainable future, it is imperative to identify and address key impact areas that significantly affect the environment, economy, and well-being of communities worldwide. Anticimex delves into three pivotal impact areas that demand immediate attention: Protecting biodiversity, preventing the spreading of pest-borne diseases, and reducing property loss and food waste. By effectively addressing these areas, stakeholders can contribute to the creation of a more resilient and flourishing planet.Impact areas in detail

As a route based service business, we constantly strive to improve our CO2e emissions. We continuously strive to optimize routes. Zero and low emission vehicles are becoming a greater part of our vehicle fleet. During 2022 Anticimex committed to the Science Based Target initiative and submitted targets. The targets were validated by the SBTi in 2023. 

With a majority of our more than 10,000 employees out visiting customers every day, it is imperative that we keep our staff as safe as possible. As a global business, we aim to promote a diverse and inclusive work environment.
We measure key social metrics down to branch level – and act on deviations immediately.

Anticimex operates in 21 countries worldwide. We ensure that we adhere to good governance standards with clear policies regarding e.g. anti-corruption and human rights. 
To ensure transparency, Anticimex implemented an anonymous SpeakUp Line with direct communication to the CEO.
Promoting local sustainability through community collaboration

Since pest control takes place locally, most of the Group’s sustainability efforts are applied at a local level, in close cooperation with the local community and relevant public agencies. Consistent with the Anticimex Model, branch managers are responsible for the sustainability performance of their branch, and Platform Presidents are responsible for the sustainability performance of their platform. 

Governance, on the other hand, is initiated at Group-level and mainly regulated by Anticimex’s Code of Conduct. The Chief Operating Officer has been assigned the responsibility for the Group’s sustainability work and the process of integrating sustainability measures.

htmlAbout Anticimex - AnticimexMarketsSearchAbout Anticimex SMARTAround the worldSustainabilityContactMarketsSearchHomeAbout us
About us
A Modern Pest Control Company

Anticimex is one of the top four global players in the pest control market by revenue, and is the leading player in the digitally-enabled pest control market based on the number of reported installations of digitally-enabled pest control units in 2021.

The group's history dates back to 1934, and it has since grown its business both organically and through acquisitions. The Group operates approximately 240 branches across 37 platforms in 21 countries across Europe, Asia, Pacific, North America, and Latin America. The Group offers pest control services and certain additional complementary services in selected markets, including hygiene and building environment services. The Group also delivers pest control and building environment services through insurance arrangements in Europe.

The expansion of the Group’s operations has been enabled through strong organic growth, digitalization, and acquisitions in existing and new markets, largely driven by the implementation of a decentralized branch-based business model in 2015. A model that leverages the local knowledge and expertise of individual branch managers, best practice sharing, as well as the launch of the Group’s technology-driven SMART solutions. 
Analyzing market dynamics
Responding to evolving market demands

The pest control market is highly fragmented with significant potential for consolidation. The industry is further characterized by a range of structural drivers, including increasing pest prevalence due to urbanization, globalization and climate change, a decreasing societal tolerance of pests due to cultural change, increased purchasing power, and increasing health, and safety regulation. The Group believes that it is well-positioned to leverage these structural growth trends in its favor.

22_ANTICIMEX-COM-OUR-HISTORY

htmlOur History - AnticimexMarketsSearchAbout Anticimex SMARTAround the worldSustainabilityContactMarketsSearchHomeOur History
Our History
A family business founded in 1934

Anticimex was founded in 1934 in Sweden as a family business offering a “no bed bugs guarantee”, which expanded during the 1950s and 1960s to include insurance in connection with its pest control services in Sweden.

The Group expanded its operations internationally outside of Sweden in the following decades, beginning with its launch in Norway in 1973, and in the late 1980s, the Group launched its building inspections and food hygiene services. In the 2000s, the Group expanded further across Europe into Denmark, Finland, Germany and the Netherlands. Since then, the Group has grown to become a global business, offering pest control and ancillary services in 21 countries across the world.

The Group’s transformation from a European multi-service company to a global pest control company was achieved through a strategic shift, involving the divestment of non-core business activities and a re-focusing on its recurring pest control offering. Strong growth, digitalization, and expansion in existing and new markets through around 350+ value-enhancing acquisitions also contributed to this transformation. For example, in 2013, the Group acquired the local pest control businesses of ISS in Australia, Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, Spain, and Switzerland.

 In 2015, the Group established the Anticimex Model, which focuses on its branches as the cornerstone of the Group. The Group also acquired a 20 percent stake in WiseCon A/S, a Danish supplier of digitally-enabled pest control products and accelerated its digital SMART concept, which uses intelligent traps and sensors to monitor and control pests. 

The Group expanded its operations into Asia through the acquisition of SITA Pest Control & Fumigation Service in Singapore. In July, the Group entered the United States market through the acquisition of Bug Doctor, American Pest and GreenStar Termite & Pest Control.

Through acquisitions, Anticimex expanded in Asia (DC Hygiene, WiseCon) and North America (Viking Termite, Modern Pest, Mid-Atlantic Pest). WiseCon's acquisition led to the Anticimex Innovation Center in Helsinge, Denmark, currently the R&D hub for the Group.

The Group entered France through the acquisition of Danton and further expanded in the North American market through the acquisition of Turner Pest Control, which has operations in Florida, and Killingsworth Environmental of the Carolinas, which has operations in North Carolina.

In 2019, Anticimex expanded further in the North American market by acquiring Waynes Pest Control, which has operations throughout Alabama, Mississippi, and Tennessee, and JP McHale Pest Management in New York State

During the fourth quarter of 2020, the Group completed its first acquisitions in Arizona, California, and Colorado. In May 2021, the Group entered its 20th country, Colombia, with the acquisition of Palmera Junior. 

By 2022, the Group made a big step by entering the UK, with the acquisition of Pestokill, one of the largest players in the country.

People & Culture

Competence development and attractive career opportunities, irrespective of background, are important to attract and retain the best people The Group’s ability to deliver modern pest control solutions that match customer needs ultimately rests on the skills and motivation of its employees A key priority for the Group is the ability to attract and retain talent. Accordingly, the Group considers it important to maintain a safe and engaging workplace that offers career opportunities, regardless of background. A diverse and inclusive workplace is beneficial to ensuring the Group’s ability to serve a global multifaceted customer base, ranging from private households to large corporations and public facilities such as airports and hospitals.

The ongoing digitalization of the pest control business requires employees to adopt new skills and improve their understanding of, and ability to master digitally-enabled solutions. The Group supports employees and develops skills through its online SMART training portal. The portal offers training and tutorials for sales, technicians and operational employees, with global coaches for local SMART teams.

The Group tracks employee satisfaction through employee surveys, conducted at least annually and carried out globally, and performance is measured using the established metric Employee Net Promoter Score (eNPS)[1] among other metrics. As a result of the decentralized Anticimex Model, the outcomes of the surveys are used to undertake improvement actions at all levels throughout the Group, identify best practices and immediately act on any negative deviations Group-wide.

The Group seeks to constantly improve its working environment based on employees’ feedback and measure key indicators that enable track improvement, performance and skills development. The Group further promotes preventive training for on-field employees in safe working practices. This includes mandatory training for drivers and for employees working in potentially dangerous or hazardous environments, such as heat treatment, fumigation, or where the service performance requires ladder work.

The Group also considers a satisfactory working environment and promising career opportunities as key to remaining an attractive option when owners of independent pest control companies consider divesting their businesses (learn more about Anticimex M&A Strategy here). Many sellers have joined the Group in management positions, branch manager roles or specialist positions.

[1] Employee Net Promoter Score (eNPS) is a measure of how likely employees are to recommend their employer as a place to work. It comes from the NPS measure more typically associated with customer satisfaction surveys and asks employees how likely they are to ‘promote’ their employer on a scale from 0 to 10. The eNPS score is calculated by taking the percentage of detractors and subtracting it from the percentage of promoters to yield an eNPS score from -100 to 100.

Their passion for the industry and dedication to their core values align perfectly with what we have been committed to at Eastside for the past 54 years.
