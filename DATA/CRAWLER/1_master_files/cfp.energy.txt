Recruitment Privacy Policy

As part of any recruitment process, CFP Energy (“Company”, “we”, “us”, “our”) collects and processes personal data relating to job applicants. The organisation is committed to being transparent about how it collects and uses that data and to meeting its data protection obligations.

What information do we collect?

The Company collects a range of information about you. This includes:

your name, address and contact details, including email address and telephone number;
details of your qualifications, skills, experience and employment history;
information about your current level of remuneration, including benefit entitlements;
whether or not you have a disability for which the organisation needs to make reasonable adjustments during the recruitment process; and
information about your entitlement to work in the UK.

The Company may collect this information in a variety of ways. For example, data might be contained in application forms, CVs or resumes, obtained from your passport or other identity documents, or collected through interviews or other forms of assessment.

We may also collect personal data about you from third parties, such as recruitment agencies and, once a job offer has been made, references supplied by former employers.

Data will be stored in a range of different places, including on your application record, in HR management systems and on other IT systems.

Why does the Company process personal data?

We need to process data to take steps at your request prior to entering into a contract with you. We may also need to process your data to enter into a contract with you.

In some cases, we need to process data to ensure that we are complying with its legal obligations. For example, it is mandatory to check a successful applicant’s eligibility to work in the UK before employment starts.

The Company has a legitimate interest in processing personal data during the recruitment process and for keeping records of the process. Processing data from job applicants allows us to manage the recruitment process, assess and confirm a candidate’s suitability for employment and decide to whom to offer a job. We may also need to process data from job applicants to respond to and defend against legal claims.

The Company may process special categories of data, such as information about ethnic origin, sexual orientation or religion or belief, to monitor recruitment statistics. We may also collect information about whether or not applicants are disabled to make reasonable adjustments for candidates who have a disability. We process such information to carry out its obligations and exercise specific rights in relation to employment.

If your application is unsuccessful, The Company may keep your personal data on file in case there are future employment opportunities for which you may be suited. We will ask for your consent before it keeps your data for this purpose and you are free to withdraw your consent at any time.

Who has access to data?

Your information may be shared internally for the purposes of the recruitment exercise. This includes members of the HR and recruitment team, interviewers involved in the recruitment process, managers in the business area with a vacancy and IT staff if access to the data is necessary for the performance of their roles.

We will not share your data with third parties, unless your application for employment is successful and we make you an offer of employment. We will then share your data with former employers to obtain references for you, employment background check providers to obtain necessary background checks.

How does the Company protect data?

We take the security of your data seriously. We have internal policies and controls in place to ensure that your data is not lost, accidentally destroyed, misused or disclosed, and is not accessed except by our employees in the proper performance of their duties.

For how long does the Company keep data?

If your application for employment is unsuccessful, the organisation will hold your data on file for 12 (twelve) months after the end of the relevant recruitment process. At the end of that period, your data is deleted or destroyed.

If your application for employment is successful, personal data gathered during the recruitment process will be transferred to your Human Resources file (electronic and paper based) and retained during your employment. The periods for which your data will be held will be provided to you in a new privacy notice.

As a data subject, you have a number of rights. You can:

access and obtain a copy of your data on request;
require the organisation to change incorrect or incomplete data;
require the organisation to delete or stop processing your data, for example where the data is no longer necessary for the purposes of processing; and
object to the processing of your data where the Company is relying on its legitimate interests as the legal ground for processing.

If you would like to exercise any of these rights, please contact compliance@cfp.energy

If you believe that the organisation has not complied with your data protection rights, you can complain to the Information Commissioner.

What if you do not provide personal data?

You are under no statutory or contractual obligation to provide data to the Company during the recruitment process. However, if you do not provide the information, we may not be able to process your application properly or at all.

Reduce emissions by reinventing fuel supply chains through innovative low carbon solutions in agriculture and energy

As regulators pursue a path to decarbonisation, biofuels present a significant opportunity to reduce fuel supply emissions across a variety of sectors.

CFP Energy supplies and offtakes physical biofuels across Western Europe and can hedge products globally. As a specialist market-maker, we connect consumers, distributors and refiners alike to keep the market developing at pace.

As businesses look to reduce their reliance on fossil fuels and actively support cleaner initiatives, incorporating biogas into your supply mix gives you an opportunity to reduce emissions through insetting.

We supply and offtake physical biogas across different European countries, and operate as a specialist market-maker for biogas certificates, providing hedging services to energy-intensive organisations.

Feedstocks are an essential component in the biofuels value chain, and understanding their nature and nuances allows clear traceability throughout the process.

CFP Energy offtakes and supplies physical feedstocks in Europe, and also provides market-making expertise worldwide for single-counting and double-counting feedstocks.

The transition to sustainable fuels is a complex path to navigate, calling for expert solutions. For businesses that rely on conventional fuels to ensure business continuity, we provide market-making and hedging strategies.

These can be subsequently bundled with low-carbon fuels to help with the energy transition ahead.

Renewable energy certificates

From challenge to credibility

From water to wind, renewable energy sources are variable by nature. When conditions are right, generated energy is fed into the power grid — but how can this be accurately tracked? With many organisations on the path to reduced climate impact via renewable energy adoption, it’s increasingly important to get a strategy in place.

Renewable energy certificates provide a solution – proving that a certain measure of electricity has been generated from renewable sources. And because they carry a precise economic and environmental value, certificates can also be traded. This turns the production of renewable energy into a marketable asset – unlocking a host of options and incentives for the businesses that are ready to benefit.

Make the most of the complex renewable energy certificates market, as we put our sector knowledge, industry relationships and operational capabilities to work for you.

CFP Energy win multiple awards in the Environmental Market Rankings 2023-2024

Following a successful year, CFP Energy is delighted to have been voted a winner in the Environmental Finance Environmental Market Rankings 2023-2024. CFP Energy were voted as winners in two awards, and runner-up in a further two. 	

Following a successful year, CFP Energy is delighted to have been voted a winner in the Environmental Finance Environmental Market Rankings 2023-2024. The rankings acknowledge CFP Energy's outstanding contributions and expertise in carbon markets and emissions trading, solidifying their position as industry leaders.

CFP Energy were voted as winners in the following awards: 

UK Trading System: Best Trading Company, OTC/Spot
EU Emissions Trading System: Best Trading Company, Options & Futures

Additionally, CFP Energy earned recognition as a runner-up in the following categories: 

EU Emissions Trading System: Best Trading Company, OTC/Spot
Energy Attribute Certificates - Europe: Best Trading Company

These awards are particularly pleasing given the rankings are based on client votes. We hope this underscores CFP Energy's efforts to provide clients with market leading solutions to manage compliance in carbon markets, particularly in the and EU ETS.

The rankings come amid a period of lower allowance prices and bearish fundamentals in the short term but companies should prepare for the challenges ahead in both the UK and EU ETS.

Tim Atkinson, Director of Carbon Sales and Structuring at CFP Energy, remarked, "Given future price forecasts expect allowance prices to be back over €100/£100 per CO2e by 2027, our view is that ETS operators face a choice on whether to decarbonise over the next 5 years, budget for higher carbon prices or use the current market to lock in compliance costs now whilst allowance prices are at favourable levels.”

With ETS targets set to tighten by 2030 and beyond, CFP Energy look forward to working with our customers to develop effective risk management strategies for carbon markets.

Clean Cookstove Projects: Debunking Headlines and Embracing Progress

Amidst the flurry of media attention surrounding clean cookstove projects, it is essential to consider a full range of standpoints to ensure that we focus on continuously improving the quality and integrity of carbon projects. Scrutiny drives change, and with it, the voluntary carbon market can continue to deliver climate finance to initiatives that go beyond emission reductions and offer meaningful benefits to communities. 	

Clean cookstove projects are seen as a key initiative for channelling funding toward addressing a major public health challenge. Today, approximately one-third of the global population, around people, cook their meals by burning coal, firewood, and animal waste on open fires or traditional stoves (WHO 2022). The smoke from traditional cooking exposes them to respiratory and cardiovascular problems and leads to around premature deaths annually, with women and children disproportionately impacted (IEA 2023). Additionally, and importantly for the voluntary carbon market, this form of cooking releases roughly of global greenhouse gas emissions and exacerbates deforestation and habitat loss due to the demand for timber, charcoal and other wood fuels (Bailis et al. 2015).

The voluntary carbon market provides a means to efficiently finance solutions to household air pollution issues, with great success. A report from the Clean Cookstove Alliance highlights a 45-fold increase in finance secured for cookstove projects on the voluntary carbon market between 2017-2023. Clean cooking is one of the fastest-growing project types in the voluntary carbon market, currently accounting for 1,368 of all 8,777 projects (Berkeley Carbon Trading Project 2023). Carbon credit retirement for cookstove projects has tripled in the past five years, with retirements in 2023 hitting 13.4 million (Trove Research).

However, cookstove projects have recently come under public scrutiny over credit quality. The latest wave of scepticism followed a UC Berkeley study published in the peer-reviewed journal Nature Sustainability. The Gill-Wiehl et al. (2024) study estimates that cookstove projects in the voluntary carbon market are on average 9.2 times over-credited. Media outlets have published articles citing the study, with The Guardian posting a headline that cookstove credits are “1,000% overstated”, and the Times claiming cookstove credits are “largely worthless”. However, the study has been met with many counterarguments from major stakeholders in the market. Gold Standard, a major carbon credit registry, stated that the study did not find actual over-estimation. Other stakeholders raised methodological scrutiny, challenging the assumption that literature values are more accurate than data collected through the projects’ monitoring process.

What is the debate?

Before making judgements, it is necessary to understand how these projects curb emissions. Clean cookstove projects achieve emissions reduction by tackling two issues: black carbon emissions and deforestation. Black carbon is the most strongly light-absorbing component of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and has significant climate warming effects in the near-term (GEF 2015). Black carbon emissions are typically generated during the incomplete combustion of carbon-based fuels, such as wood, charcoal, coal, and kerosene. Improved cookstoves facilitate more efficient combustion than traditional cooking methods and therefore emit less black carbon. More efficient combustion or using alternative fuels also means less wood is required for cooking, thereby reducing the demand for timber and mitigating deforestation.

To calculate the emissions reduction of a cookstove project, current methodologies in the voluntary carbon market consider a few key metrics, such as adoption, usage, and stacking rates, fraction of non-renewable biomass (fNRB), fuel consumption, firewood-charcoal conversion rate, emission factors (EFs), and rebound rates. See the figures below for a breakdown of each of the key metrics used in the emissions reduction calculation.

Adoption, usage and stacking rates

These rates reflect how many new stoves distributed by the project are actually in use, how many meals are cooked in the new stoves, and if the recipients are using the new stoves alongside their traditional stoves.

Fraction of non-renewable biomass (fNRB)

Cookstove projects can achieve emissions reductions by reducing timber consumption. However, net reductions can only occur when the saved biomass is non-renewable. The fNRB parameter considers how much woody biomass is harvested beyond the regeneration rate of a given area.

This metric compares the usage of cooking fuel before and after the distribution of new stoves, thereby calculating fuel use savings.

This conversion rate quantifies how much firewood is required to yield the same energy content as a given weight of charcoal. In other words, it reflects how efficiently firewood can be converted to charcoal.

This metric is a coefficient that relates the amount of carbon dioxide emitted to the fuel used.

This rate reflects how many of the stoves recipients have increased their overall cooking energy consumption due to access to a new stove.

To assess the accuracy of emissions reductions calculations in cookstoves projects, the recent study by Gill-Wiehl et al. replaced the values used for these key metrics in the sampled projects with conservative values drawn from literature. The study found that the overestimation of the fraction of non-renewable biomass (fNRB) values was the largest source of over-crediting (1.7 times), followed by inaccurate firewood-charcoal conversion efficacy rates (1.5 times), with the adoption (1.4 times) and usage (1.4 times) rates of the cookstoves being jointly the third largest source of over-crediting.

So, are cookstove projects truly worthless?

Here is our take:

Over-crediting does exist within cookstove projects, largely attributable to using outdated default values for parameters such as fNRB. Previous methods predominantly relied on default country-specific fNRB values provided by the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), typically ranging from 80-90%; however, actual fNRB values in some cases have been demonstrated to be 30-40% (Sylvera 2023). Engaging with this scrutiny and implementing rigorous ex ante analysis is crucial. It is recommended to use more accurate subnational/regional calculations, taking into account variables such as local population growth and land cover change, to ensure emissions reduction estimates are not inflated (UNFCCC 2023).
Despite the above, we should be cautious about approaching comparisons between literature values and carbon project data. As highlighted by BeZero, a project ratings agency, voluntary carbon market project-specific activities, such as regular follow-ups, stove maintenance services and incentivising practices, could result in better-performing projects compared to literature values. Drawing such comparison may oversimplify the complexities of on-the-ground implementation.
Cookstove projects, if done right, are impactful initiatives that deliver benefits beyond emission reductions. Aside from improving public health, these projects can bring meaningful co-benefits, such as significantly reducing the time spent on fuel collection, particularly benefiting women and children. There are high-quality cookstove projects out there that are bringing real benefits to local communities. When executed with precision, cookstove projects are meaningful and worth scaling up.
The voluntary carbon market is a dynamic and ever evolving force for positive change. Best practices, baselines, and default values are constantly changing. While challenges like over-crediting exist, organisations like the UNFCCC are actively working on expert consultations and will likely publish their calculations for more accurate fNRB values soon; both Verra and Gold Standard have been actively updating and developing new cookstove methodologies. The market is constantly evolving to ensure the efficacy of projects, and bridge the financing gap for tackling key issues such as household air pollution, which may otherwise struggle to attract adequate attention and resources.

In short, while there is room for improvement at the methodology level, clean cooking projects are one of the worthiest causes to support with climate finance when done right, and so the best projects ought to continue to receive financing despite mounting media scrutiny surrounding the project type as a whole.

The cookstove debate underscores the necessity for well-rounded assessment, considering academic studies, industry practices, and evolving standards. We hope that as the dialogue continues, the market can engage with this discourse constructively to develop high-quality cookstove projects that can bring positive benefits to the communities and the environment.

Liquidity solutions

From locked in to liquid assets

In today’s dynamic business environment, liquidity is essential.

Economic conditions, technological advancements and global events can affect operations at any time. Liquidity enables a business to navigate uncertainty, seize opportunity and ensure its long-term sustainability.

Renewable assets such as carbon credits and Guarantee of Origin certificates (GOs) can represent a highly valuable element of your overall sustainability portfolio – and they hold immediate financial market value. Need to unlock extra liquidity? Renewable assets can be leveraged, before being bought back at an agreed point.

If you’re looking to liquidate assets from your sustainability portfolio, you’ll need expert market knowledge to ensure that they’re traded effectively. After nearly two decades of navigating these complex markets, we’re deeply experienced in mitigating yield and cash movements. So you can be sure your solution has been structured by an expert hand, to secure an optimal financial and strategic position.

CoProtect your position. With long-term strategic structuring that defends your financial forecasts.

Maintain agility. Through well-judged short-term liquidity that releases value before buying back.

Protect credit. Any liquidity solution should minimise credit risk as a core priority.

Providing credit lines. Through our own balance sheet or trade finance facilities already in place.

Offering collateralised lending. Helping to avoid any concerns around market volatility.

Managing risk. This is central to our DNA, so it is at the forefront of any solution that we provide.

Emissions Economics: Understanding the Financial Implications on your Business

From regulatory compliance to ESG initiatives, the financial impact of the evolving energy landscape on your business is important. The balancing act between doing what's right for the future of your business, your clients, and our planet is not a simple decision, but an important one to get right. 	

The environmental sector is complex and constantly evolving but monitoring how changes could financially impact businesses is a critical step. We help business leaders and CFOs to better understand the landscape, to not only mitigate financial risk but also unlock fiscal opportunity through their energy transition journey. These lessons are valuable to everyone so we have prepared this short guide to share insight and information that can also benefit your future business decisions.

Emissions: The hidden liability in your balance sheet.

Emission liabilities exist in your balance sheet, driven by both top-down changes and bottom-up pressures.

From a top-down perspective, international climate commitments, government legislation, new industry standards, and investor demands all compound to change the energy landscape, and there is more to come. Further legislation around emissions tracking and reporting will also drive significant costs for many businesses. These - and many other net zero targets - are not going away. If anything, we see the opposite happening. Most businesses have started to take steps to report emissions but understanding the imminent financial impact is the best way to mitigate the risk.

Bottom-up pressures are a slightly different story. Markets and clients are changing in line with a new positive environmental consciousness impacting all industries. That means low emissions certificates are becoming key tender criteria whilst end-customer behaviour is also shifting towards purchasing sustainable products. This purchasing behaviour is driving the need for a brand to demonstrate their emissions reductions and commitments.

If it affects you, then it also impacts the supply chain and the end customer, so don’t be surprised to see those questions coming back up the chain.

Emissions is a new barrier to access capital.

If your supply chain is considering emissions, so are your investors. We see a change in leading banks and investment firms classifying emissions risk as financially material, impacting how they deal with stakeholders and customers and where they invest funds, both globally and locally.

The environmental agenda is fast becoming a prerequisite for dealing in capital markets and managing this risk is imperative to gain access to key financial partners.

Finding cross-border emissions requirements.

Border adjustments are likely to play a key role in global and governmental solutions to reach net zero targets more quickly. The latest example is the recently launched Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) in Europe, which introduced a carbon fee on certain imported goods.

Now more countries/regions are following Europe and creating their own version of CBAM, and we expect to see further carbon fees implemented across the globe. Under this direction, your emissions could drive new costs within your business. As you continue to transport and import goods from around the globe, the impact on your bottom line will change, and new environmental questions will be asked.

The time to act is now.

Early action leads to more emissions risk management options and opportunities. We can help you better understand the financial implications of your business’ emissions, so you can effectively navigate the evolving energy sector and make informed decisions about your energy transition journey. For more information or to chat with our Risk Management team, you can contact us below.

The voluntary carbon market (VCM) is an effective tool to help you compensate for your hard-to-abate carbon emissions while meaningfully investing in climate action, communities, and biodiversity.

CFP Energy has developed a large and diverse portfolio of high-quality credits, spanning a range of technologies and geographies. We can provide direct access to the VCM, whether through our portfolio or bespoke investment opportunities in relevant carbon projects.

We are able to source international renewable energy certificates from a range of technologies and geographies to meet your specific business requirements.

Renewable energy certificates are used to demonstrate that electricity has been generated from low carbon sources.

As carbon allowances become increasingly valuable and volatile, they represent a potential source of income and untapped liquidity.

CFP Energy works with you to utilise your carbon inventory to optimise cash flows and generate returns.

Unique structured products underpin how CFP Energy delivers superior risk management services. By working with our experienced trading team, we are able to design and implement solutions for your specific energy portfolio and overall hedging requirements.

CFP Energy’s structured solutions deliver a greater degree of flexibility ensuring maximum value, security and price certainty.

From 2024, the shipping industry will be subject to a carbon emissions cap under the EU ETS.

CFP Energy works with you to untangle shipping’s complex issues of ownership and carbon responsibility, as well as designing a bespoke strategy to ensure full ETS compliance. As market leaders, we will get you ready for compliance from 2024 onwards.

Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM)

CBAM will require importers to calculate, report and pay for carbon emissions for products imported into Europe, covering sectors such as iron, steel, cement and fertilisers.

CFP Energy can help you understand the impact of CBAM and provide solutions to manage the cost.

Clean Cookstove Projects: Debunking Headlines and Embracing Progress

Amidst the flurry of media attention surrounding clean cookstove projects, it is essential to consider a full range of standpoints to ensure that we focus on continuously improving the quality and integrity of carbon projects. Scrutiny drives change, and with it, the voluntary carbon market can continue to deliver climate finance to initiatives that go beyond emission reductions and offer meaningful benefits to communities. 	

Why is Article 6 so relevant to the VCM from a quality and integrity perspective?

With Article 6 developments set to drastically affect views on quality and integrity in the VCM, now more than ever it is essential to gain an understanding of what exactly Article 6 is, how the VCM is involved, and why it is so important. 	

The Shift to Carbon Project Investment

Voluntary carbon project investment has taken centre-stage over the last eighteen months as secondary market spot trading of carbon credits has become increasingly difficult. From inflated prices on marketplaces to the crowded world of brokered spot transactions, sourcing of carbon credits directly from carbon project investments increasingly offers a reliable alternative to the traditional methods of purchasing carbon credits.	

2023 Reflections: A Pivotal Year in the Voluntary Carbon Market

2023 proved to be a pivotal year for the Voluntary Carbon Market (VCM), marked by several developments in its trajectory. As we step into the new year, let's reflect on the past 12 months, specifically the critical insights and milestones that have shaped the VCM, its evolution and the implications for the future.

Navigating the Aviation Industry’s transition to CORSIA Phase 1

As we ring in the new year, the aviation industry is transitioning from CORSIA’s pilot phase to CORSIA phase 1. To grasp its significance, it's crucial to understand CORSIA's role and objectives.	

Waves are being made in the Voluntary Carbon Market (VCM) by the publication of a study calling for the retraction of the West et al. study used in an article by the Guardian earlier in the year to claim that "more than 90% of rainforest carbon offsets are worthless".	

COP28: voluntary carbon highlights

COP28 has been a whirlwind of activity and it feels like this is finally the time that Voluntary Carbon Markets can move on from recent troubles and find new purpose and growth.

Compliance carbon

Compliance carbon

The challenge and opportunity

Many countries are adopting Emissions Trading Schemes (ETS) as their flagship climate strategy. From power generation, industrial and manufacturing to shipping and aviation, every business within high-emitting sectors in the UK and EU now faces a cap on carbon emissions.

Both the EU ETS and UK ETS are going through significant reform which will tighten the cap from now until 2030, reduce free allocations and remove surplus allowances. These changes are forecast to increase future allowance prices and require new abatement technologies to achieve future emissions reduction targets. With this in mind, ETS operators face a choice on whether to decarbonise over the next 5 years, budget for higher carbon prices or use the carbon market to lock in compliance costs now.

We’ve been helping businesses of all sizes understand their ETS requirements for more than 15 years. From developing an effective trading strategy to purchasing the carbon allowances you need, we tailor our support to your real-world context. Providing custom compliance solutions and commercially-sound strategies that work for today's needs and tomorrow's ambition.

Where carbon markets are:

Complex and hard to access, especially for those newer to the opportunity.

Constantly changing, with a regulatory landscape that evolves at both global and local levels.

Volatile, prone to price fluctuations that can have huge financial implications.

Commercially challenging to implement as part of your carbon strategy.

Award-winning market access. Understand and optimise your access to carbon compliance markets, benefiting from our longstanding experience.

Providing clarity. Whether local or global, we will keep you up to date on the latest policy and market developments.

. Our unparalleled experience and unique suite of products helps you make informed decisions and reduce compliance costs. 

Balancing your needs. We address short and long-term requirements with commercially-sound, pragmatic strategies.

In January 2024, the EU's ETS was extended to cover carbon emissions from all large ships entering EU ports, regardless of the flag they fly. Incentivising energy efficiency, low-carbon solutions and the uptake of alternative maritime fuels, this expansion will also require the shipping sector to implement new compliance strategies. We’re here to help you set a commercially sound course from the outset of your planning.

In a dynamic business environment, liquidity is critical. It allows you to navigate uncertainty, seize opportunity and ensure long-term sustainability.

We work with you to unlock working capital through a range of bespoke solutions to ensure your financial position is well protected.

Risk Management for Carbon

Structured products underpin our ability to deliver superior risk management services. By applying industry-leading market knowledge, we’re able to design and implement structured solutions for your specific energy portfolio and overall hedging requirements. 

Receive maximum value, security and price certainty. Our structured solutions deliver a greater degree of flexibility and an optimised hedging strategy, tailor-made for your business.

Why work with us?

Whether you're buying or selling, access carbon markets and optimise your carbon compliance strategy.

Tailored risk management

Agile, thoughtful and specific compliance strategies.

Benefit from 15 years of operational ETS experience in managing EU and UK ETSs.

Real-time intelligence to support better decisions and transactions.

Solutions tailored to your short-term imperatives and long-term ambitions.
