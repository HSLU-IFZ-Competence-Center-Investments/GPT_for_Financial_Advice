6 improvements for operation and maintenance programs in the Oil & Gas industry

How does Distran streamline gas leak detection?

How does Distran streamline gas leak detection?

With a working distance from 0.3 – 100 m (1 – 330 ft), operators avoid contact with the gas and the need for scaffolding.

Inspection teams cover large areas in little time and hence reduce downtime due to planned and unplanned shutdowns.

As no expert know-how is required, new users get familiar with the Distran ultrasonic camera quickly, which further saves costs.

The leak rate quantification enables to prioritize maintenance activities based on the impact of the leak, helping cut fugitive emissions.

Distran ultrasonic imagers help expand the scope of inspections because Acoustic Leak Imaging devices detect leaks of all gas types.

USE IN HAZARDOUS AREAS

The ATEX-certified (intrinsically safe) Distran Ultra Pro X can be used for detecting gas leaks in potentially explosive areas.

Improve your facility’s safety and decrease turnaround and start-up time with Distran Ultra Pro X.

Protection of people and assets onshore and offshore

Exposed to challenging conditions, upstream operations mainly include exploration and production activities on land and on water. For instance, Floating Production Storage Offloading (FPSO) units comprise tight piping networks to process oil and gas extracted from subsea reservoirs.

Undetected leaks may lead to the release of dangerous gases, compromise the safety of workers, and cause safety-relevant equipment failures. Our upstream customers typically use an intrinsically safe leak detection device during startups/ turnarounds and regular leak surveys.

As a preventative maintenance tool, the Ultra Pro X detects leaks of all gas types that are commonly found at upstream facilities. This includes methane, nitrogen, CO2, inergen, and compressed air. The ATEX-certified device allows operators to inspect large hazardous, noisy, and hard-to-reach areas without scaffolding.

With the right gas leak detection in place, upstream companies can focus on increasing safety and performance. Distran’s mission is to empower our customer to focus on their asset performance – instead of dealing with the consequences of undetected leaks.

A cost-effective way of reducing fugitive emissions

Midstream companies operate pipelines and transmission facilities to move and distribute oil & gas from upstream to downstream. The processing of liquified natural gas (LNG) is another key midstream operation. In terms of Oil & Gas industry regulatory compliance, the reduction of fugitive emissions from methane (CH4) leaks is crucial.

Video: Methane Leak detected by the Distran Ultrasound camera – Outdoors, on a substation

Prepare for the new EU regulation on Methane Emissions

Transmission System Operators (TSO) often use a combination of different gas leak detection technologies. Many use Distran ultrasonic cameras to detect leaks of various gas types (methane, air, etc.) at pressure-reducing (sub)stations, interconnection stations, and storage & distribution sites.

Video: Small methane Leak detected by the Distran Ultrasound camera – On a compressor station

Other technologies such as Optical Gas Imaging (OGI) cameras work well for the detection of hydrocarbons. Ultrasonic cameras detect any kind of gas leaks and quantify the leak rate in real time, enabling operators to prioritize maintenance activities based on factors such as size, location, and ecological impact of the detected leaks. Some companies combine the two technologies.

To mitigate climate change, governments and international organizations push for new regulations on methane emissions. They are expected to require that oil and gas companies implement LDAR programs to ensure compliance.

The fast track to avoid downtime and maximize uptime

Downtime and even more unscheduled downtime are major concerns for downstream companies. Our acoustic cameras support refineries, petrochemical plants, and other downstream installations in both avoiding unplanned downtime and shortening scheduled downtime.

Regular turnarounds take place for legal (compliance), technical (safety), and economic (lifetime of assets) reasons. Like during commissioning, the teams in charge use our non-destructive testing (NDT) devices to check for various types of leaks (air, nitrogen, and hydrocarbons) during tightness testing. The ability to detect all types of gas leaks is a powerful feature to speed up startup processes and save time as well as money.

In addition to maintaining safety standards, leak detection and repair (LDAR) programs aim to prevent unplanned shutdowns during day-to-day operations with our cameras. Potentially leaking components that contain air, nitrogen, methane, hydrogen, acetylene, and many other gases, undergo frequent inspections. The faster, the safer, the easier – the better.

The leak rate quantification module of Distran acoustic cameras enables operators in all segments of Oil & Gas to streamline maintenance. With the integrated reporting tool Audalytics, our customers include leak rates, videos, and images in reports, classifying leaks and monitoring assets over time.

A technology to protect people, production, and performance

The proactive detection of malfunctions is a central part of the safety policy at Nuclear Power Plants (NPP) producing low-carbon electricity.

Undetected gas leaks can be an issue in various sections of NPP, i.e., on compressors, valves, turbines, condensers, etc. More and more NPP trust in Distran devices as preventative maintenance tools to detect gas leaks before they become a threat.

Various features of our acoustic cameras such as leak detection from safe distances, or leak rate quantification may be key to preventing shutdowns. Every avoided shutdown of a NPP not only saves money but also reduces CO₂ emissions, as often fossil energy must replace the NPP’s production.

Some NPP also work with Distran to test the tightness of the reactor building. This new application underlines the versatility of our devices to increase both the safety and performance of NPP.

UltraProUltrasonicleakimagingforhigh-reliabilityinspections

Redefiningstandardsingasleakinspection

The Ultra Pro hand-held ultrasound imaging camera is capable of accurately locating gas leaks from several meters with unrivaled speed. It excels in finding leaks in high or in hard-to-reach areas.

The sensor works by detecting the specific sounds that pressurized gas leaks emit. Thanks to its integrated 124 ultrasound microphones, the ultrasound camera reconstructs the position of the sound source. The information is overlaid in real-time with a wide angle optical image.

Ultra Pro creates, in a single tap, images and videos that can be assembled in reports either using Distran’s reporting software Audalytics or with the user’s preferred software.

Works with all types of gas

0.3 to 100 m

or 1 to 330 ft

or 2.10⁻⁴ cfm for a 4 bar methane leak at a 30 cm distance

or 0.7 psi
It also works with vacuum leaks

Ultrasonic Gas Leak Detection

Pinpoint gas leaks without scanning each single element

Ultrasonic Gas Leak Imaging is a technique that allows you to analyze the sound emitted by leaks and and display it as an image. It works for any gas type, even vacuum.

How Ultrasonic Gas Leak Imaging worksHow it works?

Why use Ultra Pro?

10 times faster than traditional methods

Classical gas detectors require the operator to thoroughly check every potential leak point. With Ultrasonic Imaging, the detection can be performed without scanning every single element. The inspection is done several meters away, reducing the need for scaffolding.
Reduce your exposure to gas

Leaks can be found several meters away (for bigger leaks up to 100 meters away). The operator has less or no exposure to the hazardous location.
Uncover leaks in unexpected locations

As sound propagates beyond our line of sight, hidden leaks that are missed with other techniques can be detected with Ultrasonic Imaging.

Ultra Pro is able to quantify the leak rate (in liters per hours or in cubic feet per minute) in a few seconds without using a tripod.

Quantify gas leak rates and prioritize maintenance

Estimating gas leak rates has never been this easy

Thanks to its 124 sensors, Ultra Pro can not only locate leaks but also quantify the severity of a gas leak within seconds and without the need for a tripod. From the sound source loudness, a gas flow rate is automatically converted in real-time. It is not affected by the background noise. The leak rate quantification makes it possible to prioritize the maintenance and inform the decisions regarding the repair of the leaks.

Additionally, the ultrasonic camera Ultra Pro estimates, in real-time, its limit of detection in the current environment given the user selected settings. It enables the operator to validate his inspection.

Locate partial discharges, such as corona, tracking, arcing

Ultra Pro also pinpoints partial discharges and other electrical faults

Partial discharges such as Corona discharges, arcing and tracking happen in high-voltage systems and may lead to failures. These phenomena produce ultrasound and can be precisely localized with Ultra Pro.

Inspection reports with Audalytics

Ultrasonic imaging shines when it comes to reports because images speak more than a thousand words when it comes to describing a leak location. Furthermore, Distran has developed an integrated reporting tool, called Audalytics, that enables the operator to create a report with annotations within minutes after the inspection. The report can then be shared within all stakeholders without additional software, directly in the browser where videos are embedded seamlessly.
Special software features allow data-trending, dashboard functions and recording of voice notes.

Best-in-class handling in the field

From the beginning, Ultra Pro has been developed with industrials and by people who have performed many inspections in the past. Weighing only 1.5 kg including the battery, the camera is operated with a single hand, so that the operator can safely inspect, even in a staircase. The camera has also been tested for drops, in design to be robust. Its integrated LED lighting illuminate dark areas without the need for a separate light source.

1.5 kg all inclusive

1400 lumens, integrated LED lighting

The only ATEX Certified ultrasound camera in the world

In January 2021, Distran announced the Ultra Pro X, the world’s first ATEX certified ultrasound camera.

Ultra Pro X is the ATEX certified version of Ultra Pro, specifically designed for use within potentially explosive atmospheres for the oil and gas, chemistry and power plant industry.

What distance can a leak be detected?

Depending on the flow rate of the leak, from 30 centimeters (1 feet) to 50-100 meters (150-300 feet). Large leaks (thousand of liters per hour) can be detected up to 50 meters. Small leaks (a few liters per hour) are detectable at a few meters. Typical leak search distance is between 1 to 6 meters (3 to 20 feet).

What type of gases can be detected?

A difference in pressure of 50 mbar (0.7 psi) is recommended for good detection. Below this, it is still be possible to detect gas leaks, but the detection limit of the device is higher. The difference can also be negative (vacuum leaks).

Which gases can be detected ? Does it work with vacuum leaks?

The camera does not detect gases directly but the sound leaks make when the gas is escaping (learn more about technology). Vacuum leaks can also be detected because they create turbulences and thus ultrasounds. What is needed is a minimum pressure difference (typically 50 mbar / 0.7 psi) and a path in the air for the sound to propagate.

Is it possible to operate Ultra Pro in noisy areas (compressor rooms, gas turbine enclosure, etc.)?

Ultra Pro filters all noises outside the detection window, in particular low frequency in the audible range. Even in a very noisy environment like in gas turbine noise enclosure with up to 100 dB(A) noise, leakages have been detected.

Ultra Pro estimates in real-time its lower limit of detection (LoD), allowing the user to know how accurate the inspection is. This is typically useful when acceptance criterion is used.

Can I inspect underground or insulated systems?

Direct sight is not required for leak detection, but the sound must propagate from the leak to the surface of Ultra Pro, where the microphones are located. This is typically not the case for underground systems (shielded by soil). For insulated systems it depends on how tight the insulation is.

What is the accuracy of Ultra Pro?

Similar to an optical camera, the accuracy is determined as an angle (the closer you are to a leak, the smaller is the linear accuracy). The accuracy depends on the acoustic imaging algorithm, the imaging frequency and how good the optical camera and the microphone array are matched.

The typical accuracy is about 1°.

Is the device ATEX Certified / Intrinsically Safe?

Ultra Pro X is the ATEX certified / intrinsically safe version of Ultra Pro. It is certified for zone 2 gas for class IIC (USA: div 2 class 1), including hydrogen.

Does Distran supply a tool to generate digital reports?

Yes. With every device, Distran includes free access to its reporting tool Audalytics. Pictures and videos can be included in reports along with notes and comments. It is easily shared between stakeholders.

 To which distance can a leak be detected? 

Depending on the flow rate of the leak, from 30 centimeters (1 feet) to 50-100 meters (150-300 feet). Large leaks (thousand of liters per hour) can be detected up to 50 meters. Small leaks (a few liters per hour) are detectable at a few meters. Typical leak search distance is between 1 to 6 meters (3 to 20 feet).

 What types of gases can be detected? Does it work with vacuum leaks? 

Ultra Pro does not detect gases directly but the sound leaks make when the gas is escaping (learn more about technology). Thus, the camera can detect leaks of any gas type, a 50 mbar (0.7 psi) difference in pressure is recommended for a good detection, as well as an open path in the air for the sound to propagate.

Ultra Pro is not limited to gas types, it can detect hydrocarbons, hydrogen, noble gases, compressed air, steam, etc. Negative pressures are also detectable, so Ultra  Pro can pinpoint vacuum leaks too.

Below 50 mbar, it is still be possible to detect gas leaks, but the detection limit of the device is higher. The difference can also be negative (vacuum leaks).

 Is it possible to operate Ultra Pro in noisy areas (compressor rooms, gas turbine enclosure, etc.)? 

Ultra Pro filters all noises outside the detection window, in particular low frequency in the audible range. Even in a very noisy environment like in gas turbine noise enclosure with up to 100 dB(A) noise, leakages have been detected.

Discover Ultra Pro X

EDF‘s nuclear power plant in Dampierre-en-Burly, produces ~20 TWh of low-CO2-emitting electricity per year (around 8% of France’s nuclear electricity production), equivalent to the electricity consumption of 4 million homes.

At a nuclear power plant, safety is key. That’s why, the early detection of any equipment malfunction is paramount to guaranteeing the availability of such facilities.

Searching for and repairing leaks of compressed air, steam, and vacuum (air ingress), as well as various other gases, are among the preventive operations carried out. The teams in charge have been using the Distran ultrasound camera since 2021.

“The Distran ultrasonic camera has proved to be an invaluable tool,
helping us to monitor numerous pieces of equipment. 

Such as our production system of control air (SAR),
ventilation systems (HVAC), or to monitor our condenser, kept at a negative pressure. 

And, to ensure proper operation of equipment, such as the ones monitoring the radioactivity in the environment,

Plant Manager – EDF NPP Dampierre-en-Burly

Tense energy context: no compromise on safety and security

In January 2023, the French electricity production network was excessively strained, in particular as a result of the stress corrosion cracking encountered on French nuclear plants. At the time, it was vital to guarantee the availability of the Dampierre-en-Burly facilities. Then, an air leak was detected on a valve of the turbine bypass system (called “GCTa” in French) as part of a periodic test campaign.

A leak on this equipment triggers a so-called group 1 event. This means:

In accordance with the safety regulations, the teams in charge have 8 hours to determine the damages and ensure that it has no impact on safety.
If failed, the unit must be shut down to start maintenance operations.
To avoid a shutdown, the teams must be able to quantify the leak, monitor it over time, and ensure that it remains below the safety thresholds.

The leak was initially detected with soap spray, method which do not provide leak rate quantification. The alternative methods regularly deployed at Dampierre-en-Burly are proven techniques, such as a smoke machine or acoustic monitoring.

However, these are complex technologies and do not provide conclusive results in such a short timeframe.

EDF takes advantage of swift leak rate quantification

Due to the time pressure, the teams in charge counted on the Distran acoustic camera to take on the challenge:

The Ultra Pro enabled the staff to quantify the leak rate and set up the monitoring over time in under 1 hour.
Once the leak rate had been quantified and determined to be well below the regulatory thresholds, the production management team decided to continue.
In addition, long-term monitoring was put in place. To date, the size of the leak has not exceeded the regulatory threshold.

Later during the year, operators detected another leak on the same equipment. Again, the responsible staff could measure the leak rate quickly with the Distran device and execute appropriate repair activities to continue production.

Distran’s integrated reporting tool Audalytics includes leak rates, photos, and videos captured with Ultra Pro to create inspection reports in a few clicks. This feature is very useful for comparing the collected data and monitoring the evolution of leaks over time, which is a central element of asset management and maintenance.

How Distran Ultra Pro ultrasound cameras support Nuclear Power Plants:

“The unique features of the Distran acoustic camera, in particular the quantification of the leak rate,
empowered us to estimate the degree of urgency for intervention. 

In addition to ensuring continuity of supply to the network, the avoided shutdown
would have cost between 5 to 6 million euros per day of shutdown.”

Plant Manager – EDF NPP Dampierre-en-Burly

Diagnostics and monitoring: safeguarding the availability of France’s nuclear power plants fleet

As for all French nuclear power plants, EDF’s paramount objective in Dampierre-en-Burly is to produce low-carbon electricity safely and reliably. Distran ultrasonic cameras are in use at numerous French nuclear power plants. Various departments such as Operations, Engineering, Reliability, HVAC, Automatisms, Testing & Monitoring, Taps & Valves (mechanics) use the devices as diagnostics tools.

As described above, Distran has helped EDF Dampierre-en-Burly avert a shutdown that would have cost 5 to 6 million euros per day. To safeguard the plant’s availability today and in the future, the Distran ultrasound camera is a central element of the periodic tests carried out to ensure that the installations are in good condition, which include:

On-demand tests, led by Testing & Monitoring departments to look for air ingress on the condenser (vacuum: 1mbar of pressure loss is equivalent to 1MWh not produced).
Weekly or bi-monthly tests by the Operations with air line tests and gas park inspections.
MSR department tests to detect air and steam leaks.
SPR department tests to detect CO2.

Discover Ultra Pro X

Founded in 2017, Ignite Outage Group LLC is made up of a team of experts across multiple disciplines such as gas turbines, steam turbines, and generators. The company offers technical and engineering services for the Heavy Duty Commercial, Utility, and Industrial Energy sectors. As the detection of gas leaks is a crucial element for services such as commissioning and outage planning, Ignite counted on Distran’s Ultrasonic Camera at a combined cycle power plant (CCCP) located in the USA. The 827 MW plant consists of three combined cycle units with separated dry Air-Cooled Condensers (ACC).

How to detect leaks without interfering with plant operations?

Leaks due to cracks and cuts, e.g. on the ACC, downgrade performance. The traditional leak inspection method at the American 827 MW CCCP, i.e. by spraying helium around the relevant areas in combination with a downstream sensor, entailed various issues. Hence, Ignite set out to find a new solution enabling them to:

REDUCE THE EXPOSURE TO HOT AREAS

INCREASE THE PRECISION OF LEAK LOCALIZATION

DECREASE THE REQUIRED EXPERT KNOW-HOW

Different from traditional gas leak detection technologies such as soap spray, sniffers, or infrared cameras, Distran Ultrasonic Cameras (learn more about Ultra Pro and Ultra Pro X in the Products section) harness Acoustic Leak Imaging (ALI), i.e. use ultrasounds to detect leaks of all gas types from safe distances.

High pressure for high performance

Equipped with a Distran Ultrasonic Camera, the team in charge inspected the plant’s three condenser systems. As the vacuum pressures are essential to protect the steam turbines and maintain performance, they focused on detecting atmospheric air leaks into the condenser system negatively impacting the vacuum pressure.

The two-day survey took place during regular plant operation and resulted in findings:

8 vacuum leaks on the ACC.
5 vacuum leaks on the compensator.
2 steam leaks on the low-pressure steam turbine casing.
11 compressed air leaks.

Vacuum leak detected on the ACC

Vacuum leak detected on the compensator

With Audalytics, Distran’s integrated reporting tool, the team in charge created a report including all findings documented in real-time with pictures, videos, and voice recordings.

Based on this report, the plant operator prioritized and scheduled the necessary repairs for the next regular shutdown.

Vacuum performance to ensure power plant availability

The Distran Ultra Pro enabled the operator of a UK-based power plant to detect and pinpoint a 7.5 mbar vacuum loss on the condenser system.

This vacuum loss caused a decrease in production estimated to 7,862 MWh over a six-month period, equivalent to a 1 500 000 USD loss
(approx. 1 384 000 €).

This vacuum loss caused a decrease in production estimated to 7,862 MWh over a six-month period, equivalent to a
1 500 000 USD loss
(approx. 1 384 000 €).

Both a technical and economic impact

The inspection with the Distran Ultrasonic Camera took much less time compared to the previous approach. Additionally, the team in charge covered larger areas, found leaks from safe distances, and gathered more data.

As explained here, the detection of vacuum leaks can have a strong technical and economic impact:

A 0.35 inches Hg (12 mbar) average improvement in condenser vacuum can lead to a 30-70 Btu/kWh heat rate improvement.
This can result in annual fuel, operations, and maintenance savings of up to 100 000 USD for an 827-MW CCCP.

Detection of leaks of hazardous gases in hard-to-reach areas

A proven preventative maintenance tool

Previously, leak detection activities required a lot of energy consumption, human resources, scaffolding, time, and ultimately costs. For instance, to search a tank for leaks by soaping it up, could take weeks. For reasons often related to safety regulations, it was much more difficult to check for leaks during normal operations.

Different from traditional leak detection technologies such as soap spray and sniffers, Distran’s approach is based on Acoustic Leak Imaging. Detecting the specific sounds vacuum and gas leaks generate, our devices allow for searching for leaks from safe distances and regardless of the type of gas.

Chemical plants benefit from this new approach, as they can reduce the material, staff, time, and ultimately costs of inspections. Even if they check for small leaks of toxic or explosive gases, it is much easier to align safety concerns with reliability goals.

Therefore, the ATEX-certified Distran ultrasonic camera has proven to be especially effective for the detection of hazardous gases such as hydrogen and acetylene.

Ultra CE for Composite Manufacturing Detect leaks on vacuum bags

Speed up vacuum leak inspection

Composite manufacturing requires a perfect vacuum, as any leak in a bag can compromise the final product quality and will require additional time for repair. The traditional leak detection methods are tedious, time-consuming and heavily user-dependent.

Including a software dedicated to specific needs of composite manufacturers, the hand-held Ultra CE detects leaks at a distance and with unmatched speed. Ultra CE excels in finding leaks in noisy areas.

Ultra CE’s 124 microphones detect ultrasounds and reconstruct the location of the sound source, i.e. the leak. Combining the acoustic information with the wide-angle optical camera, the precise location of the leak is shown on the screen on the back of the ultrasound camera.

The real-time visualization enables staff to fix leaks efficiently. The recorded images and videos can easily be used for reporting purposes.

Detects leaks in seconds at a distance, even in folds:

or 1 to 165 ft

Ultrasonic Vacuum Leak Detection

Pinpoint vacuum leaks without scanning each single square centimetre

Acoustic Leak Imaging is a technique that allows you to analyse the sound emitted by leaks, determine their exact location, and display them on the camera’s screen.

How Distran enhances bagging process efficiency

Ultrasonic Vacuum Leak Detection

Pinpoint vacuum leaks without scanning each single square centimetre

Acoustic Leak Imaging is a technique that allows you to analyse the sound emitted by leaks and display it as an image.

Enhance bagging process efficiency

Why use Ultra CE?

10 times faster than traditional methods

Traditionnal methods to detect vacuum leaks, such as human hearing or ultrasonic detectors with headphones, require the operator to thoroughly check every potential leak point with the risk of missing leaks. With ultrasound imaging, detection is performed at a distance, much faster and leak locations are clearly visible on screen.
Uncover leaks in bag folds

As sound propagates, hidden leaks in folds that are hardly found with other techniques can be detected with ultrasound imaging.
Repeatable and efficient method

Ultra CE is an easy-to-use device, so anyone can find leaks reliably, even at a distance. Survey images are self-explanatory.
Robust to surrounding noise

Ultra CE actively filters background noises and detects leaks even in noisy areas such as production halls.ULTRA CE IN COMPOSITE MANUFACTURING

Inspection reports with Audalytics

Ensure traceability through digital reporting

Images say more than a thousand words when it comes to finding leaks. To keep track of these findings, Distran offers an integrated reporting tool ; Audalytics. It enables the operator to create a report embedding pictures, videos, and notes within minutes after the inspection.

Operators can then share their findings with their team, directly in the browser where videos are embedded seamlessly (without requiring an additional software). Special software features allow data-trending, dashboard functions and recording of voice notes.

 From which distance can a vacuum bag be inspected by Ultra CE? 

Depending on the flow rate of the leak, from 30 centimetres (1 foot) up to 50 or even 100 meters (150-300 feet). Large leaks (thousands of litres per hour) can be detected up to 100 meters.

However, to make sure that the vacuum bag is leak tight, the typical leak search is performed between 30 centimetres (1 foot) and 1 metre (3,3 feet).

 Can Ultra CE also detect leaks on the connectors below the mould? 

Ultra CE detects the ultrasound that leaks generate when air is entering into a vacuum system. Therefore, the camera can detect leaks on adaptors, connectors to the pump, etc.

 What is the accuracy of Ultra CE? 

Like an optical camera, the accuracy is determined as an angle (the closer you are to a leak, the smaller is the linear accuracy). The accuracy depends on the acoustic imaging algorithm, the imaging frequency and how good the optical camera and the microphone array match.

The typical accuracy is about 1°.

 Is it possible to operate Ultra CE in noisy production halls close to vacuum pumps, compressors, cranes…? 

Ultra CE filters all noises outside the ultrasound detection window, in particular low frequency in the audible range. Leakages have been detected within noisy environments as production halls.

Ultra CE estimates the sensitivity in real-time, allowing the user to know if the inspection is performed in optimal conditions. This is typically useful when acceptance criterion is used.

 Can Ultra CE detect leaks below curing blankets or insulation? 

Direct sight is not required for leak detection, but the sound must propagate from the leak to the surface of Ultra CE, where the microphones are located. This is typically not the case if a curing blanket is placed on top of the vacuum bag. For insulated systems it depends on how tight the insulation is.

 Does Distran supply a tool to generate digital reports? 

Yes. With every device, Distran includes free access to its reporting tool Audalytics. Pictures and videos can be embedded in reports along with notes and comments. Later easily shared between stakeholders.

Redefiningstandardsingasleakinspection

The Ultra Pro hand-held ultrasound imaging camera is capable of accurately locating gas leaks from several meters with unrivaled speed. It excels in finding leaks in high or in hard-to-reach areas.

The sensor works by detecting the specific sounds that pressurized gas leaks emit. Thanks to its integrated 124 ultrasound microphones, the ultrasound camera reconstructs the position of the sound source. The information is overlaid in real-time with a wide angle optical image.

Ultra Pro creates, in a single tap, images and videos that can be assembled in reports either using Distran’s reporting software Audalytics or with the user’s preferred software.

Works with all types of gas

or 0.7 psi
It also works with vacuum leaks

Ultrasonic Gas Leak Detection

Pinpoint gas leaks without scanning each single element

Ultrasonic Gas Leak Imaging is a technique that allows you to analyze the sound emitted by leaks and and display it as an image. It works for any gas type, even vacuum.

How Ultrasonic Gas Leak Imaging worksHow it works?

Why use Ultra Pro?

10 times faster than traditional methods

Classical gas detectors require the operator to thoroughly check every potential leak point. With Ultrasonic Imaging, the detection can be performed without scanning every single element. The inspection is done several meters away, reducing the need for scaffolding.
Reduce your exposure to gas

Leaks can be found several meters away (for bigger leaks up to 100 meters away). The operator has less or no exposure to the hazardous location.
Uncover leaks in unexpected locations

As sound propagates beyond our line of sight, hidden leaks that are missed with other techniques can be detected with Ultrasonic Imaging.

Ultra Pro is able to quantify the leak rate (in liters per hours or in cubic feet per minute) in a few seconds without using a tripod.

Quantify gas leak rates and prioritize maintenance

Estimating gas leak rates has never been this easy

Thanks to its 124 sensors, Ultra Pro can not only locate leaks but also quantify the severity of a gas leak within seconds and without the need for a tripod. From the sound source loudness, a gas flow rate is automatically converted in real-time. It is not affected by the background noise. The leak rate quantification makes it possible to prioritize the maintenance and inform the decisions regarding the repair of the leaks.

Additionally, the ultrasonic camera Ultra Pro estimates, in real-time, its limit of detection in the current environment given the user selected settings. It enables the operator to validate his inspection.

Locate partial discharges, such as corona, tracking, arcing

Ultra Pro also pinpoints partial discharges and other electrical faults

Partial discharges such as Corona discharges, arcing and tracking happen in high-voltage systems and may lead to failures. These phenomena produce ultrasound and can be precisely localized with Ultra Pro.

Inspection reports with Audalytics

Ultrasonic imaging shines when it comes to reports because images speak more than a thousand words when it comes to describing a leak location. Furthermore, Distran has developed an integrated reporting tool, called Audalytics, that enables the operator to create a report with annotations within minutes after the inspection. The report can then be shared within all stakeholders without additional software, directly in the browser where videos are embedded seamlessly.
Special software features allow data-trending, dashboard functions and recording of voice notes.

Best-in-class handling in the field

From the beginning, Ultra Pro has been developed with industrials and by people who have performed many inspections in the past. Weighing only 1.5 kg including the battery, the camera is operated with a single hand, so that the operator can safely inspect, even in a staircase. The camera has also been tested for drops, in design to be robust. Its integrated LED lighting illuminate dark areas without the need for a separate light source.

The only ATEX Certified ultrasound camera in the world

In January 2021, Distran announced the Ultra Pro X, the world’s first ATEX certified ultrasound camera.

Ultra Pro X is the ATEX certified version of Ultra Pro, specifically designed for use within potentially explosive atmospheres for the oil and gas, chemistry and power plant industry.

What distance can a leak be detected?

Depending on the flow rate of the leak, from 30 centimeters (1 feet) to 50-100 meters (150-300 feet). Large leaks (thousand of liters per hour) can be detected up to 50 meters. Small leaks (a few liters per hour) are detectable at a few meters. Typical leak search distance is between 1 to 6 meters (3 to 20 feet).

What type of gases can be detected?

A difference in pressure of 50 mbar (0.7 psi) is recommended for good detection. Below this, it is still be possible to detect gas leaks, but the detection limit of the device is higher. The difference can also be negative (vacuum leaks).

Which gases can be detected ? Does it work with vacuum leaks?

The camera does not detect gases directly but the sound leaks make when the gas is escaping (learn more about technology). Vacuum leaks can also be detected because they create turbulences and thus ultrasounds. What is needed is a minimum pressure difference (typically 50 mbar / 0.7 psi) and a path in the air for the sound to propagate.

Is it possible to operate Ultra Pro in noisy areas (compressor rooms, gas turbine enclosure, etc.)?

Ultra Pro filters all noises outside the detection window, in particular low frequency in the audible range. Even in a very noisy environment like in gas turbine noise enclosure with up to 100 dB(A) noise, leakages have been detected.

Ultra Pro estimates in real-time its lower limit of detection (LoD), allowing the user to know how accurate the inspection is. This is typically useful when acceptance criterion is used.

Can I inspect underground or insulated systems?

Direct sight is not required for leak detection, but the sound must propagate from the leak to the surface of Ultra Pro, where the microphones are located. This is typically not the case for underground systems (shielded by soil). For insulated systems it depends on how tight the insulation is.

What is the accuracy of Ultra Pro?

Similar to an optical camera, the accuracy is determined as an angle (the closer you are to a leak, the smaller is the linear accuracy). The accuracy depends on the acoustic imaging algorithm, the imaging frequency and how good the optical camera and the microphone array are matched.

The typical accuracy is about 1°.

Is the device ATEX Certified / Intrinsically Safe?

Ultra Pro X is the ATEX certified / intrinsically safe version of Ultra Pro. It is certified for zone 2 gas for class IIC (USA: div 2 class 1), including hydrogen.

Does Distran supply a tool to generate digital reports?

Yes. With every device, Distran includes free access to its reporting tool Audalytics. Pictures and videos can be included in reports along with notes and comments. It is easily shared between stakeholders.

 To which distance can a leak be detected? 

Depending on the flow rate of the leak, from 30 centimeters (1 feet) to 50-100 meters (150-300 feet). Large leaks (thousand of liters per hour) can be detected up to 50 meters. Small leaks (a few liters per hour) are detectable at a few meters. Typical leak search distance is between 1 to 6 meters (3 to 20 feet).

 What types of gases can be detected? Does it work with vacuum leaks? 

Ultra Pro does not detect gases directly but the sound leaks make when the gas is escaping (learn more about technology). Thus, the camera can detect leaks of any gas type, a 50 mbar (0.7 psi) difference in pressure is recommended for a good detection, as well as an open path in the air for the sound to propagate.

Ultra Pro is not limited to gas types, it can detect hydrocarbons, hydrogen, noble gases, compressed air, steam, etc. Negative pressures are also detectable, so Ultra  Pro can pinpoint vacuum leaks too.

Below 50 mbar, it is still be possible to detect gas leaks, but the detection limit of the device is higher. The difference can also be negative (vacuum leaks).

 Is it possible to operate Ultra Pro in noisy areas (compressor rooms, gas turbine enclosure, etc.)? 

Ultra Pro filters all noises outside the detection window, in particular low frequency in the audible range. Even in a very noisy environment like in gas turbine noise enclosure with up to 100 dB(A) noise, leakages have been detected.

Hydrogen tightness testing with acoustics

Detecting hydrogen leakages from a safe distance

Hydrogen is enjoying an unprecedented momentum as many countries directly support investment in hydrogen technologies. Hydrogen production, storage and transportation pose technical challenges, as hydrogen is highly flammable and checking for leaks is an essential step for its safe use.

Ultra Pro X enables operators to perform fast and safe inspections as it provides operators with the exact location of each leak, from a distance. The Distran technology is also efficient outdoors and is ATEX certified (intrinsically safe).

 Read about Ultra Pro

The challenges with hydrogen

A highly flammable gas, prone to escape

Hydrogen has a low ignition energy.
It possesses a very broad flammability range, from 4% to 74% concentration in air,
making it much more explosive than methane for instance.
This is a tiny molecule, stored at high pressures (between 200 and 1000 bar / 2900 to 14500 psi). Coupled with the metal embrittelment phenomenon, the risk of leaks is therefore greatly increased.
Hydrogen has no odor nor color, making a leak indiscernible.

Methods based on gas detection are not adapted

Hydrogen gas detectors requires the gas to enter the detector. Portable sniffers put operators at risks by being within potential dangerous zones. Outdoors, fixed detectors have high chance of missing hydrogen leaks, as the gas is lighter than air and quickly escape. Infrared detectors (including OGI cameras) do not detect hydrogen, as H2 does not absorbs infrared, like any homonuclear diatomic molecules (N2, O2, etc.).

With these methods, the risk of not detecting a leak is high and the time spent in inspections is long.

Why do gas leaks produce ultrasounds?

Many physical processes, such as gas leaks, partial discharges or mechanical defects, create acoustic emissions (AE). Ultrasounds are often the first indication that an element is starting to fail, well before heat/infrared emissions (if any).

How does ultrasound imaging work

From sounds to images

The surface of Ultra Pro is composed of dozens of sensors that measure the sound field. When an ultrasound wave hits the surface, each sensor detects it at a different time. These differences are used to locate the ultrasound sources and overlay their location on to a video image. Ultra Pro takes into account an unlimited number of sources simultaneously.

Quantification of gas leak rate

From sounds to gas leak rate

In addition to locating the leak, Ultra Pro is able to estimate the flow escaping through a leak in liters per hour, based on the acoustic emission strength and the pressure difference at the leak. This allows the user to quickly asses the severity and the cost associated with the leak. Furthermore, the smallest detectable leak in the current environment is automatically displayed in real-time (patent pending).

Why Composite Manufacturers choose Ultra CE

Testimonial: “Ultra CE significantly improves our process”

“80% of the leaks usually happen at similar locations. The remaining 20% are extremely time consuming, and often impossible, to locate with traditional methods. The leaks we cannot find will cause production delays as well as defects in parts. 

Ultra CE pinpoints any leaks instantly.
It’s a game changer: results are immediate and reliable.”

Process Engineer, Equipment Development

Vacuum Leak detection by ultrasound imaging

How ultrasound imaging works on vacuum leaks

Vacuum leaks create turbulence in their vicinity, on both sides of the envelope. Turbulence, in turn, create sounds and ultrasound, which propagate to the sensor. The 124 ultrasound transducers of Ultra CE capture the ultrasound waves at different times (diﬀering by less than a millisecond). These little time differences are processed by the device in real-time to display the location of the sound source; the leak.

Distran ultrasound camera pinpoints leaks instantly. Inspection results are immediate and easy to understand. Anyone can conduct comprehensive, reliable, actionable leak inspections.

START USING WITHOUT EXPERT KNOW-HOW

Distran’s acoustic cameras are intuitive, easy-to-use devices. Anyone can use the only 1.5 kg (3.3 lb) heavy, one hand-held acoustic cameras displaying the exact locations of gas leaks and all the relevant data even in noisy areas.

DETECT GAS LEAKS 10X FASTER

By finding leaks from safe distances Distran’s gas leak detection cameras reduce the need for scaffolding. Inspection times are up to 10x shorter than with traditional methods that require contact with the gas or expert know-how.

DETECT LEAKS OF ANY TYPE OF GAS

As they detect ultrasounds generated by the pressure difference between the pressurized system and the outside environment, Distran Ultrasonic Cameras pinpoint leaks of all types of gas. A pressure difference of 50mbar is sufficient.

QUANTIFY THE LEAK RATE IN REAL-TIME

Distran Ultrasonic Cameras quantify and display the leak rate in real-time, i.e. the size of detected leaks. Inspection specialists harness this feature to evaluate the costs of leaks and hence to prioritize maintenance activities.

AVOID CONTACT WITH THE GAS

Acoustic gas detection makes contact with the gas obsolete. Improving the safety of staff, Distran Ultra Pro, Distran Ultra Pro X, and Distran Ultra CE enable staff to detect gas leaks from a safe distance of up to 100 m (300 ft).

INSPECT WITH AN ATEX-CERTIFIED DEVICE

Announced in January 2021 and specifically designed for the use within potentially explosive areas, Distran Ultra Pro X is the intrinsically safe (ATEX-certified) version of Distran Ultra Pro to detect gas leaks fast, safely, and reliably.

UltraProUltrasonicleakimagingforhigh-reliabilityinspections

Redefiningstandardsingasleakinspection

The Ultra Pro hand-held ultrasound imaging camera is capable of accurately locating gas leaks from several meters with unrivaled speed. It excels in finding leaks in high or in hard-to-reach areas.

The sensor works by detecting the specific sounds that pressurized gas leaks emit. Thanks to its integrated 124 ultrasound microphones, the ultrasound camera reconstructs the position of the sound source. The information is overlaid in real-time with a wide angle optical image.

Ultra Pro creates, in a single tap, images and videos that can be assembled in reports either using Distran’s reporting software Audalytics or with the user’s preferred software.

Works with all types of gas

0.3 to 100 m

or 1 to 330 ft

or 2.10⁻⁴ cfm for a 4 bar methane leak at a 30 cm distance

or 0.7 psi
It also works with vacuum leaks

Ultrasonic Gas Leak Detection

Pinpoint gas leaks without scanning each single element

Ultrasonic Gas Leak Imaging is a technique that allows you to analyze the sound emitted by leaks and and display it as an image. It works for any gas type, even vacuum.

How Ultrasonic Gas Leak Imaging worksHow it works?

Why use Ultra Pro?

10 times faster than traditional methods

Classical gas detectors require the operator to thoroughly check every potential leak point. With Ultrasonic Imaging, the detection can be performed without scanning every single element. The inspection is done several meters away, reducing the need for scaffolding.
Reduce your exposure to gas

Leaks can be found several meters away (for bigger leaks up to 100 meters away). The operator has less or no exposure to the hazardous location.
Uncover leaks in unexpected locations

As sound propagates beyond our line of sight, hidden leaks that are missed with other techniques can be detected with Ultrasonic Imaging.

Ultra Pro is able to quantify the leak rate (in liters per hours or in cubic feet per minute) in a few seconds without using a tripod.

Quantify gas leak rates and prioritize maintenance

Estimating gas leak rates has never been this easy

Thanks to its 124 sensors, Ultra Pro can not only locate leaks but also quantify the severity of a gas leak within seconds and without the need for a tripod. From the sound source loudness, a gas flow rate is automatically converted in real-time. It is not affected by the background noise. The leak rate quantification makes it possible to prioritize the maintenance and inform the decisions regarding the repair of the leaks.

Additionally, the ultrasonic camera Ultra Pro estimates, in real-time, its limit of detection in the current environment given the user selected settings. It enables the operator to validate his inspection.

Locate partial discharges, such as corona, tracking, arcing

Ultra Pro also pinpoints partial discharges and other electrical faults

Partial discharges such as Corona discharges, arcing and tracking happen in high-voltage systems and may lead to failures. These phenomena produce ultrasound and can be precisely localized with Ultra Pro.

Inspection reports with Audalytics

Ultrasonic imaging shines when it comes to reports because images speak more than a thousand words when it comes to describing a leak location. Furthermore, Distran has developed an integrated reporting tool, called Audalytics, that enables the operator to create a report with annotations within minutes after the inspection. The report can then be shared within all stakeholders without additional software, directly in the browser where videos are embedded seamlessly.
Special software features allow data-trending, dashboard functions and recording of voice notes.

Best-in-class handling in the field

From the beginning, Ultra Pro has been developed with industrials and by people who have performed many inspections in the past. Weighing only 1.5 kg including the battery, the camera is operated with a single hand, so that the operator can safely inspect, even in a staircase. The camera has also been tested for drops, in design to be robust. Its integrated LED lighting illuminate dark areas without the need for a separate light source.

1.5 kg all inclusive

1400 lumens, integrated LED lighting

The only ATEX Certified ultrasound camera in the world

In January 2021, Distran announced the Ultra Pro X, the world’s first ATEX certified ultrasound camera.

Ultra Pro X is the ATEX certified version of Ultra Pro, specifically designed for use within potentially explosive atmospheres for the oil and gas, chemistry and power plant industry.

What distance can a leak be detected?

Depending on the flow rate of the leak, from 30 centimeters (1 feet) to 50-100 meters (150-300 feet). Large leaks (thousand of liters per hour) can be detected up to 50 meters. Small leaks (a few liters per hour) are detectable at a few meters. Typical leak search distance is between 1 to 6 meters (3 to 20 feet).

What type of gases can be detected?

A difference in pressure of 50 mbar (0.7 psi) is recommended for good detection. Below this, it is still be possible to detect gas leaks, but the detection limit of the device is higher. The difference can also be negative (vacuum leaks).

Which gases can be detected ? Does it work with vacuum leaks?

The camera does not detect gases directly but the sound leaks make when the gas is escaping (learn more about technology). Vacuum leaks can also be detected because they create turbulences and thus ultrasounds. What is needed is a minimum pressure difference (typically 50 mbar / 0.7 psi) and a path in the air for the sound to propagate.

Is it possible to operate Ultra Pro in noisy areas (compressor rooms, gas turbine enclosure, etc.)?

Ultra Pro filters all noises outside the detection window, in particular low frequency in the audible range. Even in a very noisy environment like in gas turbine noise enclosure with up to 100 dB(A) noise, leakages have been detected.

Ultra Pro estimates in real-time its lower limit of detection (LoD), allowing the user to know how accurate the inspection is. This is typically useful when acceptance criterion is used.

Can I inspect underground or insulated systems?

Direct sight is not required for leak detection, but the sound must propagate from the leak to the surface of Ultra Pro, where the microphones are located. This is typically not the case for underground systems (shielded by soil). For insulated systems it depends on how tight the insulation is.

What is the accuracy of Ultra Pro?

Similar to an optical camera, the accuracy is determined as an angle (the closer you are to a leak, the smaller is the linear accuracy). The accuracy depends on the acoustic imaging algorithm, the imaging frequency and how good the optical camera and the microphone array are matched.

The typical accuracy is about 1°.

Is the device ATEX Certified / Intrinsically Safe?

Ultra Pro X is the ATEX certified / intrinsically safe version of Ultra Pro. It is certified for zone 2 gas for class IIC (USA: div 2 class 1), including hydrogen.

Does Distran supply a tool to generate digital reports?

Yes. With every device, Distran includes free access to its reporting tool Audalytics. Pictures and videos can be included in reports along with notes and comments. It is easily shared between stakeholders.

 To which distance can a leak be detected? 

Depending on the flow rate of the leak, from 30 centimeters (1 feet) to 50-100 meters (150-300 feet). Large leaks (thousand of liters per hour) can be detected up to 50 meters. Small leaks (a few liters per hour) are detectable at a few meters. Typical leak search distance is between 1 to 6 meters (3 to 20 feet).

 What types of gases can be detected? Does it work with vacuum leaks? 

Ultra Pro does not detect gases directly but the sound leaks make when the gas is escaping (learn more about technology). Thus, the camera can detect leaks of any gas type, a 50 mbar (0.7 psi) difference in pressure is recommended for a good detection, as well as an open path in the air for the sound to propagate.

Ultra Pro is not limited to gas types, it can detect hydrocarbons, hydrogen, noble gases, compressed air, steam, etc. Negative pressures are also detectable, so Ultra  Pro can pinpoint vacuum leaks too.

Below 50 mbar, it is still be possible to detect gas leaks, but the detection limit of the device is higher. The difference can also be negative (vacuum leaks).

 Is it possible to operate Ultra Pro in noisy areas (compressor rooms, gas turbine enclosure, etc.)? 

Ultra Pro filters all noises outside the detection window, in particular low frequency in the audible range. Even in a very noisy environment like in gas turbine noise enclosure with up to 100 dB(A) noise, leakages have been detected.

Ultra Pro estimates in real-time its lower limit of detection (LoD), allowing the user to know how accurate the inspection is. This is typically useful when acceptance criterion is used.

Distran’s mission is to make industrial plants safer and reduce their environmental footprint through the use of sound sensing and technology.

Workers use their ears every day, consciously or unconsciously, to assess machine conditions. Traditional acoustic sensors have long been used for that purpose, but are limited by the background sounds present in typical industrial environments. Phased-array sensors developed by Distran overcome this limitation by spatially filtering the sounds. It becomes possible to locate defects, such as leaks or discharges, while being at a safe distance.

Distran is a spin-off from the Autonomous System Lab, ETH Zurich, developing advanced acoustic sensors for industrial applications.

years of scientific research

Our cameras are used in

countries, and in space

Back in 2011, two engineers, Joël Busset and Florian Perrodin, developed a camera at ETH Zurich, the world’s 4th best university for engineering and technology (Top Universities, 2020), that was able to locate sounds, in order to help locate and save people trapped in debris after disaster.

The acoustic camera was able to produce high-definition images in real-time, a breakthrough for real-world applications. With the support of the Autonomous System Lab, the two founders were able to convince the jury of the ETH Pioneer Fellowship to give them the initial funds necessary to develop the first product and find commercial partners.

A few years later, the company was founded, and its first two strong partnerships with Alstom and RUAG allowed the founders to improve the technology and adapt it to ultrasonic frequencies. A new device was designed and tested in power plants which resulted in multiple success stories, saving hundreds of thousands of euros for the plant owners, not counting the strong positive impact on the environment through the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and energy savings.

Currently, Distran employs more than 65 people and keeps a strong focus on R&D, developing novel algorithms to improve ultrasound imaging. Ultrasound cameras are designed, assembled and tested in-house in Zurich (read Distran’s Quality Policy). Distran is able to support customers worldwide.

An ultrasound imaging leader

Distran, a pioneer in passive acoustic imaging

Since its inception, Distran has been focused to radically improve the performance of acoustic arrays and to develop technologies at the service of valuable causes, such as environmental or safety related. Advanced algorithms were developed to allow non-specialists to use the device, without extensive training. Throughout years of development, Distran invented many acoustic devices and algorithms allowing a broader use of the passive acoustic imaging technology.

2011 | World’s first real-time portable acoustic camera

Back in 2011, acoustic cameras were used by R&D labs to optimize acoustic emissions of cars and other consumer products such as coffee and washing machines. They needed expensive and heavy acquisition boards, weighing more than 20 kgs, to simultaneously acquire dozens of microphone signals. Then, acoustic imaging was done in post-processing. To enable easier field measurements, we developed a novel acquisition board, smaller than a credit card, and directly connected to a computer by USB. The device was not only easily transportable, but also the first acoustic camera producing high definition acoustic images in real-time, enabling users to directly understand the system under study.

2012 | World’s first acoustically transparent spherical camera

Planar acoustic cameras are compact but can only locate sound sources placed in front of the camera. To get a 360° field of view, we patented a novel spherical camera that was acoustically transparent. Existing spherical cameras were either full inside and too small to locate low frequency sounds, or were bigger and packed with cables at the center thereby disturbing wave fronts. Ours, an icosahedron, was fully empty: the key was to hide all the cabling inside the faces of the icosahedron, enabling waves to propagate undisturbed and get an unparalleled precision.

2013 | World’s first ultrasonic camera

So far, acoustic cameras were mostly used to improve the audible properties of objects (such as cars). However, acoustic emissions were already used in the industry to diagnose failures such as partial discharges or gas leaks. Therefore, we decided to design a camera that would be sensitive to these high pitch sounds. In 2013, we got the world’s first ultrasound images using a three-dimensional acoustic imaging algorithm. Ultrasounds visualized were generated by the blades of an electric razor. It was also possible to precisely locate the friction points of the blades, as well as the noise created by the gearboxes.

2018 | World’s first acoustic autofocus

Autofocus is well known in optical cameras, it gives crisp images and prevents from getting any blur at the focus distance. Acoustic cameras also need to be well focused, otherwise images produced are blurry and difficult to understand. To make sure no acoustic source, such as gas leak remains undetected, we developed an acoustic autofocus able to find the distance of a sound source in real-time while getting crisp ultrasound images. In addition, this distance, combined with the amplitude received at the microphones, is used to estimate the source sound level, which in turn is used, for example, to calculate the flow rate of a leak.

2020 | World’s first acoustic camera in space

Manned space flights require an atmosphere in spaceships. Any leak, at best, increases the need of resupply of the spaceship, at worst, compromises the safety of the crew. NASA started evaluating the best available solution to find these leaks. After months of tests and space qualification, we received the great news that our camera was going to be sent to the ISS in the following days, making it the world’s first acoustic camera used in space.

2020 | World’s first ATEX acoustic camera

Ultrasound cameras do not require contact with the gas when trying to detect leaks, which is a big advantage. Though, operators may have to enter areas classified as hazardous, because gases potentially leaking may be flammable or explosive. Tools worn or carried by operators must never become an ignition source and manufacturers have to bring the proof of it. That is what the ATEX norm is about. At the end of 2020, Distran certified its camera complies with ATEX, making it the world’s first ATEX acoustic camera.

Developing unique technologies for meaningful applications having real users is a challenging yet rewarding social and professional experience. If you want to see the result of your work and to be part of the next discoveries, apply here.
