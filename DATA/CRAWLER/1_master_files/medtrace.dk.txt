She will join CEO Martin Stenfeldt and COO Rune Wiik Kristensen as part of management and play a vital role in the fast scaling of the company towards commercialization in the USA, MedTrace’s future key market. 

CFO Ann Kristin Led 

Danish pharma company MedTrace is in a transformation process. With four clinical partners onboard in Europe and FDA’s approval to commence the company’s phase III trial, MedTrace is on its way to broader commercialization.

This is where Ann Kristin Led steps in – a heavyweight financial strategist with 15 years of experience in the financial part of the pharmaceuticals industry. Before MC2 Therapeutics, her most recent position, where she spent three years as Exec. Vice President of Finance and Strategy, she spent 11 years at Danish pharma company Lundbeck. Most recently, in the role of Director of Business Development.

“I am stepping in at a fascinating time in the history of MedTrace. The company has an innovative product that is well on its way to full commercialization and a well-structured organization full of highly dedicated and talented people. From a financial perspective, this is an ideal platform to build from, and I’m excited about the challenges ahead and the successes that I hope we will share as a team”, says Ann Kristin Led, the newly appointed CFO of MedTrace.

Martin Stenfeldt, CEO of MedTrace, is happy to finally welcome Ann Kristin Led after a long search for just the right candidate.

“As a financial talent and person, Ann Kristin Led is a highly valued expansion of the MedTrace family. We are moving at a pace that calls for a dedicated financial strategist with industry knowledge, the skillset to tackle both numbers and strategy, and the ability to build and nurture our investor relations. We have that in Ann Kristin Led. In addition, I look forward to the new perspectives and skills that she will add to our management team”, says Martin Stenfeldt, CEO at MedTrace.

Ann Kristin Led’s key focus will be to finetune and expand MedTrace’s financial function and manage investor relations. In addition, she steps into the management team alongside CEO Martin Stenfeldt and COO Rune Wiik Kristensen, who have joined forces since the founding of MedTrace in 2015.

Semi-automated software for 15O-water PET myocardial blood flow analysis 

IMPORTANT NOTICE: MedTrace’s products are not currently cleared for routine use in any markets, including both the US and Europe. In the US, 15O-water is currently under investigation as an investigational drug in a Phase 3 clinical trial. In Europe, its use is in compliance with approvals granted by national drug authorities, in accordance with the specific legislation of each member state. 

aQuant is a software suited for the semi-automated and robust analysis of 15O-water. The underlying algorithms of aQuant have been used in research and reported in more than 30 peer-reviewed articles over the last decade. 

Each 15O-water scan is segmented using Cluster Analysis, automatically extracting the blood input function. 

aQuant is a semi-automated software that provides high quality quantitative images of bloodflow, which use to be a challenge for 15O-water. 

Automated generated result ready for manual QC. 

Results of MBF at stress and rest are presented as short and long axis images, polarmaps and in tabular form. Build-in quality control helps the reviewer assess the quality of the scan. 

Results are summarized on a report page and can be exported to local PACS system. Parametric images can likewise be exported for documentation or subsequent fusion with CT angiogram. 

Images of anonym’s kindly provided by Prof. Jens Sörensen, Uppsala University Hospital. 

These input functions are then further used to generate diagnostic images using 15O-water’s simple kinetic model. The high-contrast images of Perfusable Tissue Fraction (PTF) are then used for automated segmentation of the heart itself. Since PTF does not represent blood flow, this eliminates observer bias in low-blood flow regions. 

	By automatic generation, reorientation and segmentation of quantitative parametric images of blood flow, results
are ready for review with hardly any user interaction necessary.

A solution for cGMP compliant production for 15O-water 

IMPORTANT NOTICE: MedTrace’s products are not currently cleared for routine use in any markets, including both the US and Europe. In the US, 15O-water is currently under investigation as an investigational drug in a Phase 3 clinical trial. In Europe, its use is in compliance with approvals granted by national drug authorities, in accordance with the specific legislation of each member state. 

We are developing an advanced Point of Care chemistry laboratory (referred to as P3) that adheres to cGMP standards. This innovative facility seamlessly integrates both the production of 15O-water and its administration to the patient in a fully automated process. Linked to a cyclotron, the P3 transforms 15O-gas into 15O-water. A unique injections system delivers the tracer to the patient through a venous catheter. 

Combined ShapeCreated with Sketch. 

	P3 in details - 1 min. video	

P3 has a height of approx. 60 in/150 cm. 

P3 can be operated from the machine itself or in the control room. 

P3 is shielded with 2 in/5 cm of lead. 

Full cardiac examination consisting of both a rest and stress scan with two identical doses can be completed within 30 minutes1 

Due to the short half-life of only 122 seconds, the patient can stay on the scanner bed between scans removing the hassle of repositioning.

The P3 (A) is placed next to a PET-CT scanner (B) and connected to an onsite cyclotron (C). Both proton and deuteron cyclotrons are applicable. The cyclotron needs to be within certain distance to the P3. 

Four easy steps to 15O-water PET scanning 

Once the patient and the PET scanner (B) are ready, the P3 (A) will call for 15O- gas from the connected cyclotron. 

The P3 will convert the 15O-gas (C) into 15O-water under cGMP conditions, prepare the desired dose, and inject it into the patient in one automated process. Dose turnaround time can be less than 4 minutes1. 

For cardiology, the procedure is repeated after a stress agent is injected. Due to the short half-life of 15O-water, the repeat scan can start only 10 minutes1 after the initial scan has started. 

Once the scan procedure is completed, the aQuant software can analyze the image data and provide the physician (D) with absolute cardiac flow images, values per cardiac segment to be used for aiding clinical interpretation.

Eliminating diagnostic uncertainty via better perfusion imaging 

Perfusion imaging provides medical professionals with a functional understanding of the organs blood supply inside the patient. 

MedTrace is developing a solution that will help healthcare providers diagnose patients even more accurately and quickly.

Our solution allows for absolute blood flow quantification based upon the PET tracer 15O-water, which has long been acknowledged as the gold standard tracer for perfusion imaging.

Our innovative solution is intended to making 15O-water practically available right next to the PET scanner connected to an onsite cyclotron, with a software package to quantify the myocardial blood flow and perfusion. 

Based in Denmark, MedTrace has already installed systems in both Denmark and Sweden and is establishing operations in the USA as well. 

15O-water is a very short-lived radioactive version of regular water, in which the oxygen atom has been replaced by oxygen-15, a positron-emitting isotope. 

MedTrace has developed a solution with an automated chemistry system for manufacturing and infusion of 15O-water and an analytical software platform for 15O-water PET. 

The MedTrace team is growing 

MedTrace’s team is growing quickly, and we are looking for people who are excited about cutting-edge technology that can help patients be diagnosed accurately and efficiently.

For more information on the 15O-water RAPID-WATER clinical trial, visit:Radiolabeled Perfusion to Identify Coronary Artery Disease Using Water To Evaluate Responses of Myocardial Flow – Full-Text View – ClinicalTrials.gov 

According to statistics from the American Heart Association, Heart Disease remains the no. 1 cause of death in the United States: Coronary Heart Disease (CHD) accounted for approximately 12.6% of deaths in the United States in 2018, causing 360,900 deaths.

Approximately every 40 seconds, someone in the United States will have a myocardial infarction, and the estimated direct and indirect cost of heart disease from 2017 to 2018 (average annual) was $228.7 billion in the United States1.

The leading cause of CHD is Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) which is the slow build-up of plaque in the coronary arteries, which can eventually lead to heart attack due to constriction of blood flow to the heart muscle.

“Having the means to effectively diagnose CAD with high accuracy and further quantify the progression of disease is a top priority in all developed healthcare systems given the sheer societal impact”, says , COO of MedTrace Pharma A/S.

“If successful, 15O-water PET could provide an important new diagnostic platform for evaluating CAD. We hope that the platform will save lives through earlier disease detection and lead to better disease management”, Rune Wiik Kristensen says.

The company announces that the trial is fully funded, the first trial sites are already identified, and enrollment is expected to commence in Q2 2022 and continue for 12 months.

MedTrace intends to further stimulate investigator-initiated trials in the US for other indications than CAD, by accommodating their desires to reference the MedTrace approved IND and use the technology in expanded research. Similar measures are being taken in the EU.

“The mission of MedTrace is to spread the clinical utility of 15O-water PET into additional disease areas. To achieve this goal, we strive to develop strong research partnerships with clinicians with great ideas about where 15O-water may play a role. We see it as a platform technology as perfusion plays a role in a multitude of different diseases, rendering the market potential very high” says CEO Martin Stenfeldt, MedTrace Pharma A/S.

About the RAPID-WATER Trial

The trial is a Phase 3, prospective, open-label, multicenter study of [15-O]-H2O injection for PET imaging of subjects with suspected CAD. Approximately 182 evaluable participants with suspected CAD referred for noninvasive stress testing will be included in the study at approximately 10 study sites in the United States and Europe. Approximately 215 participants will be enrolled in total to account for an estimated 15% drop-out rate. Screening assessments will occur between -21 and 0 days prior to enrollment to confirm eligibility. All participants will receive two doses of [15-O]-H2O as part of a single PET imaging session (one dose at rest and one during pharmacological stress with adenosine).

The Phase 3 trial has been long anticipated with excitement as described by the Principal Investigator Marcelo Di Carli, Brigham & Women’s Hospital, Boston, MA, USA:

“As Principal Investigator of the RAPID-WATER study, I am thrilled by the news that the FDA has issued a ‘may proceed’ letter for the study sponsored by MedTrace. The multicenter, international RAPID-WATER study seeks to test the clinical effectiveness and safety of 15O-water and MedTrace’s unique automated production system as a clinical myocardial perfusion imaging agent to be used with Positron Emission Tomography in the United States. Cardiac PET is a powerful non-invasive imaging test to diagnose coronary artery disease and the addition of 15O-water will expand the list of imaging agents available for clinical use. I look forward to starting this exciting study”, Marcelo Di Carli says.

Radioactive water (15O-water) is a radiopharmaceutical generated by the conversion of oxygen-15 gas from a cyclotron into water. The process requires the addition of hydrogen gas and heat. The half-life of Oxygen-15 is 122 seconds, making it challenging to scale the use of the tracer in clinical routine. However, the short half-life also significantly reduces the scan time of the patient as well as the radioactive dose compared to conventional radiopharmaceuticals for the same indication. The scientific community generally recognizes radioactive water as the ideal perfusion and blood flow tracer as it is chemically identical to water which is the main constituent of blood.

MedTrace has automated the production and administration of the radioactive tracer and will be using the automated solution in the RAPID-WATER clinical trial.

15O-water is a very short-lived radioactive version of regular water, in which the oxygen atom has been replaced by oxygen-15, a positron-emitting isotope 

IMPORTANT NOTICE: MedTrace’s products are not currently cleared for routine use in any markets, including both the US and Europe. In the US, 15O-water is currently under investigation as an investigational drug in a Phase 3 clinical trial. In Europe, its use is in compliance with approvals granted by national drug authorities, in accordance with the specific legislation of each member state. 

15O-water is not metabolized in the body during a PET study.3 15O-water diffuses freely across the cell membrane and is therefore the optimal flow tracer, as its signal is affected only by flow. It has a half-life of 122 seconds, which makes it possible to acquire multiple image scans in rapid sequence.

15O-water has been used as non-invasive gold standard for qualifying a number of methods including myocardial perfusion MR4 and SPECT5, FFR6 and echo7.

The short half-life of 15O-water further means that the patient radioactivity dose is the lowest achievable and down to 0.4 mSv pr. Scan8. The worldwide average natural dose to humans is about 2.4 mSv per year. 

MYOCARDIAL PERFUSION IMAGING WITH PET 

This study measures the absolute myocardial blood flow using PET. It also discusses the characteristics of the radioactive tracers, that are available. It is shown that 15O-water is superior to the other tracers. 

COMPARISON OF CORONARY CT ANGIOGRAPHY, SPECT, PET, AND HYBRID IMAGING FOR DIAGNOSIS OF ISCHEMIC HEART DISEASE DETERMINED BY FRACTIONAL FLOW RESERVE 

This comparative study shows that positron emission tomography (PET), using 15O-water as a tracer, exhibits the highest accuracy for diagnosis of myocardial ischemia. 

QUANTITATIVE ASSESSMENT OF MYOCARDIAL PERFUSION IN THE DETECTION OF SIGNIFICANT CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE 

	This study examines the cutoff values for absolute MBF and to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of quantitative 15O-water positron emission tomography (PET). It concludes that the use of 15O-water in PET provides high diagnostic performance for quantitative MBF measurements.

The First Scientific Article Based on a MedTrace-Sponsored Study Has Been Published 

MedTrace is proud to see the methodology paper “Rationale and design of the RAPID-WATER-FLOW trial: Radiolabeled perfusion to identify coronary artery disease using water to evaluate responses of myocardial FLOW” published in Journal of Nuclear Cardiology (2024) vol. 31. The article is authored, among others, by Principal Investigator of the trial Marcelo F. Di Carli and it is the first scientific publication to come from a MedTrace-sponsored study.

The Phase III clinical trial RAPID-WATER-FLOW aims to test the diagnostic performance of 15O-water PET MPI to detect clinically significant epicardial coronary artery disease (CAD), while also addressing and improving on some of the limitations of the 15O-water tracer.

While the methodology paper of the trial is published in Journal of Nuclear Cardiology (2024) vol. 31, the trial is also the center of attention in an editorial in the same issue by Anisiia Crowley, MD, and Myron Gerson, MD, titled “The future of PET imaging: Looking forward to more choices and increased precision with the use of oxygen-15 water.”  

The two authors discuss the limitations and possible benefits of both the RAPID-WATER-FLOW trial and 15O-water in general, and MedTrace is pleased to read that they look forward to the results of the trial, as Crowley and Gerson writes:

“The design [of RAPID-WATER-FLOW] is exciting and innovative with clear potential to advance cardiac imaging.”

At MedTrace, Emily Vandenbroucke, Senior Director of Clinical Affairs, comments on the editorial:  

“I appreciated that Crowley and Gerson specifically highlighted the use of fractional flow reserve (FFR) and instantaneous wave-free ratio (iFR) as a “more clinically precise” truth standard for moderate stenoses, and how the study design will ultimately result in a “more accurate and generalizable description of the diagnostic performance of oxygen-15 water imaging.”  We are proud of these inclusions in the study design. As the authors point out, we also incorporate myocardial blood flow quantification as part of the blinded assessment of the oxygen-15 water images.”

“I too look forward to seeing the results of the RAPID-WATER-FLOW trial as we hope it will pave the way for making MedTrace’s PET point-of-care solution available in clinical practice to the benefit of patients and healthcare professionals,” says Emily Vandenbroucke.

IMPORTANT NOTICE: MedTrace’s products are not currently cleared for routine use in any markets, including both the US and Europe. In the US, 15O-water is currently under investigation as an investigational drug in a Phase 3 clinical trial. In Europe, its use is in compliance with approvals granted by national drug authorities, in accordance with the specific legislation of each member state. 

MedTrace is dedicated to becoming a global leader in perfusion imaging. Our products are under development and are being designed to help patients be diagnosed quickly and accurately.

Our goal is to innovate PET diagnostic imaging by transforming blood flow quantification. We will do this by making 15O-water PET practically available in clinical settings.

Based in Denmark and the US, we are a team of diverse ages, cultures, and professional backgrounds.

Our company is collaborating with university hospitals in Europe, Japan, and the USA to develop and test our products. This is part of preparing our solution for regulatory approval in various regions of the world. 

How we got started 

Our co-founder Rune Wiik Kristensen wondered why 15O-water is considered the gold standard3 for perfusion imaging, but it was not used routinely clinically. Rune, who had worked as a radiochemist in two of Denmark’s top hospitals, also wondered why cardiac PET (position emission tomography) wasn’t on the radar of most clinicians in the field, given the great success of oncological PET.

He learned that 15O-water was impractical in a clinical setting because it had such a short half-life, rendering the supply chain near impossible to scale up. Yet he also deduced that the short half-life, if controlled, would provide for reduced patient dosage and shorter scan times, increasing the feasibility of cardiac PET.

Rune decided to try to invent a device that would allow 15O-water to be produced right next to a PET scanner in a hospital, overcoming the short half-life and making 15O-water practically available. 

Sketched on a dinner napkin 

About this time, Rune met MedTrace’s other co-founder, Martin Stenfeldt. Martin was an independent executive consultant who helped companies draw up and develop their business plans.

Martin became enthusiastic about the potential for 15O-water in a clinical setting. The two had lunch together in a restaurant in Vejle, Denmark, and sketched out the idea for MedTrace on a dinner napkin.

Peter Larsen, an experienced inventor of chemistry devices, was approached to help create the physical device that would manufacture and infuse 15O-water next to the patient in a PET scanner, and thus became the third co-founder.

The new company was born, and officially registered in January 2015. The result was the development of MedTrace’s P3 system. As of August 2023 more than 3000 patients have been clinically scanned in Denmark with MedTrace system. 

Creating software for 15O-water diagnosis 

Meanwhile, Hans Harms, a Dutch PhD student was working under supervision of the Dutch physicist, Mark Lubberink to create analytical software that could analyze 15O-water PET images. Mark relocated to Uppsala University Hospital (Sweden) where he met Professor Jens Soerensen, a Dane working in Uppsala. Professor Soerensen helped Hans find funding to work further on the project in Aarhus, Denmark, where he met Lars Poulsen Tolbod, a hospital physicist.

Together, they created the novel analysis software that became aQuant, which aims to deliver a variety of clear images of the area scanned while it quantifies blood flow to enhance diagnostic abilities of the clinician. 

The two groups met by coincidence at an industry conference in San Diego and realized that their products complimented each other perfectly. After feedback from multiple potential investors, the decision was made to merge the two companies under the common name MedTrace Pharma in August 2018.

Since then, the company has continued to grow, and is now considered a development stage company with beginning revenue. 

In December 2020, Aarhus University Hospital received a magistral exemption for clinical use of MedTrace’s P3 system as well as authorization for the use of non-CE marked medical device components of the P3 system. Since then, the Danish Medicines Agency has granted exemption for clinical perfusion studies using the P3 system and the aQuant analytical software at Aarhus University hospital and Copenhagen University hospital. Aarhus University Hospital has scanned more than 3000 patients using the MedTrace P3 system.

At the Series B financing round in May 2021, MedTrace attracted a strong syndication of investors in the form of ATP, BankInvest and Vækstfonden from Denmark, Swisscanto Private Equity from Switzerland and the European Innovation Council. MedTrace finished a new series of funding in September 2023 primary based on the existing investor group.

MedTrace has since 2021 received 16 patents within 4 different “patentfamilies” here among its system for modelling the human heart in EP, JP, US, CN.

MedTrace moved to its existing premises in DTU Sciencepark in Hørsholm near Copenhagen that includes showroom featuring hardware and software. In Sept. 2022 MedTrace opened its US office out of Medical Alley in Minneapolis, MN.

A solution for cGMP compliant production for 15O-water 

IMPORTANT NOTICE: MedTrace’s products are not currently cleared for routine use in any markets, including both the US and Europe. In the US, 15O-water is currently under investigation as an investigational drug in a Phase 3 clinical trial. In Europe, its use is in compliance with approvals granted by national drug authorities, in accordance with the specific legislation of each member state. 

We are developing an advanced Point of Care chemistry laboratory (referred to as P3) that adheres to cGMP standards. This innovative facility seamlessly integrates both the production of 15O-water and its administration to the patient in a fully automated process. Linked to a cyclotron, the P3 transforms 15O-gas into 15O-water. A unique injections system delivers the tracer to the patient through a venous catheter. 

Combined ShapeCreated with Sketch. 

	P3 in details - 1 min. video	

P3 has a height of approx. 60 in/150 cm. 

P3 can be operated from the machine itself or in the control room. 

P3 is shielded with 2 in/5 cm of lead. 

Full cardiac examination consisting of both a rest and stress scan with two identical doses can be completed within 30 minutes1 

Due to the short half-life of only 122 seconds, the patient can stay on the scanner bed between scans removing the hassle of repositioning.

The P3 (A) is placed next to a PET-CT scanner (B) and connected to an onsite cyclotron (C). Both proton and deuteron cyclotrons are applicable. The cyclotron needs to be within certain distance to the P3. 

Four easy steps to 15O-water PET scanning 

Once the patient and the PET scanner (B) are ready, the P3 (A) will call for 15O- gas from the connected cyclotron. 

The P3 will convert the 15O-gas (C) into 15O-water under cGMP conditions, prepare the desired dose, and inject it into the patient in one automated process. Dose turnaround time can be less than 4 minutes1. 

For cardiology, the procedure is repeated after a stress agent is injected. Due to the short half-life of 15O-water, the repeat scan can start only 10 minutes1 after the initial scan has started. 

Once the scan procedure is completed, the aQuant software can analyze the image data and provide the physician (D) with absolute cardiac flow images, values per cardiac segment to be used for aiding clinical interpretation.

CEO Ann Kristin Led and CTO Lars Trolle in front of MedTrace’s automated manufacturing system (P3 MT-100) that produces, doses, and injects 15O-water. The now CE marked Patient Kits connect the P3 MT-100 to the patient via a venflon.

MedTrace recently gained its first CE mark for two of its medical devices less than 12 months after submitting the technical file. Obtaining the European CE mark demonstrates the company’s commitment and ability to successfully and in a short time bring a product from research and development to a commercial launch, says Senior Director of QA & RA at MedTrace, Maja Damby Carøe.

With great anticipation, MedTrace reveals today that the company has obtained the MDR Certification and its first CE mark for its patient kits.

The medical devices are part of MedTrace’s automated manufacturing solution for producing, dosing, and injecting 15O-water to patients during PET exams.

Senior Director of QA & RA at MedTrace, Maja Damby Carøe, says:

“I am immensely proud of our achievement. Receiving the MDR Certificate and the first CE mark proves that MedTrace has the team and processes in place to generate extensive technical documentation, solve complex uncertainties in due time, and finally achieve market clearance for medical devices.”

“As a young pharma and medical device company, the first CE mark is a major advancement for us and the groundwork is now laid for the market clearance of our entire 15O-water solution,” says Maja Damby Carøe.

The now CE marked Patient Kits connect the company’s automated manufacturing system (P3 MT-100) to the patient via a venflon. The Patient Kits along with the P3 MT-100, are currently in use at several university hospitals in the U.S. and Europe as part of the company’s phase III clinical trial. 

Market Clearance of aQuant is Expected Next

MedTrace is also in the final stages of developing its evaluation software, aQuant. It is expected that this software will offer analysis of the quantitative myocardial blood flow during PET exams with 15O-water. MedTrace anticipates celebrating aQuant as its next market clearance achievement. 

Pharma and medical device company MedTrace focus on radiopharmaceuticals with an ultra-short half-life and is currently working to make 15O-water available in clinical practice. The company has an ongoing phase III clinical trial that seeks to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy and safety of  15O-water as a myocardial perfusion PET imaging agent.

MedTrace recently celebrated that it had activated four new U.S. sites, bringing the total number to six activated sites across Denmark and the U.S.

The company has offices north of Copenhagen, Denmark, and in Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA. 

This news release by MedTrace Pharma A/S (the “company”) includes “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

P3

Core Values
Investors, Grants & Awards

A GMP compliant production and delivery system under development for 15O-water. 

We are developing a Point-of-Care GMP-compliant chemistry lab (P3) that combines the production of 15O-water with the infusion of the tracer into the patient – in one automated process. Connected to a cyclotron, the P3 converts the 15O-gas to 15O-water . A unique injection system delivers the tracer to the patient via venous catheter. P3 is currently not FDA approved nor CE-marked (medical device). 

Combined ShapeCreated with Sketch. 

	P3 in details - 1 min. video	

P3 has a height of approx. 60 in/150 cm. 

P3 can be operated from the machine itself or in the control room. 

P3 is shielded with 2 in/5 cm of lead. 

A full cardiac examination consisting of both a rest and stress scan with two identical doses can be completed within 30 minutes. 

Due to the short half-life of only 122 seconds, the patient can stay on the scanner bed between scans removing the hassle of repositioning.

The P3 (A) is placed next to a PET-CT scanner (B) and connected to an onsite cyclotron (C). Both proton and deuteron cyclotrons are applicable. The cyclotron can be placed up to 1,600 feet/500 meters away from the PET scanner. 

Four easy steps to 15O-water PET scanning. 

Once the patient and the PET scanner (B) are ready, the P3 (A) will call for 15O- gas from the connected cyclotron. 

The P3 will convert the 15O-gas (C) into 15O-water under GMP conditions, prepare the desired dose, and inject it into the patient in one automated process. Dose turnaround time can be less than 4 minutes. 

For cardiology, the procedure is repeated after a stress agent is injected. Due to the short half-life of 15O-water, the repeat scan can start only 10 minutes after the initial scan has started. 

Once the scan procedure is completed, the aQuant software can analyze the image data and provide the physician (D) with absolute cardiac flow values per cardiac segment and the cardiac ejection fraction.

15O-water is a very short-lived radioactive version of regular water, in which the oxygen atom has been replaced by oxygen-15, a positron-emitting isotope 

IMPORTANT NOTICE: MedTrace’s products are not currently cleared for routine use in any markets, including both the US and Europe. In the US, 15O-water is currently under investigation as an investigational drug in a Phase 3 clinical trial. In Europe, its use is in compliance with approvals granted by national drug authorities, in accordance with the specific legislation of each member state. 

15O-water is not metabolized in the body during a PET study.3 15O-water diffuses freely across the cell membrane and is therefore the optimal flow tracer, as its signal is affected only by flow. It has a half-life of 122 seconds, which makes it possible to acquire multiple image scans in rapid sequence.

15O-water has been used as non-invasive gold standard for qualifying a number of methods including myocardial perfusion MR4 and SPECT5, FFR6 and echo7.

The short half-life of 15O-water further means that the patient radioactivity dose is the lowest achievable and down to 0.4 mSv pr. Scan8. The worldwide average natural dose to humans is about 2.4 mSv per year. 

MYOCARDIAL PERFUSION IMAGING WITH PET 

This study measures the absolute myocardial blood flow using PET. It also discusses the characteristics of the radioactive tracers, that are available. It is shown that 15O-water is superior to the other tracers. 

COMPARISON OF CORONARY CT ANGIOGRAPHY, SPECT, PET, AND HYBRID IMAGING FOR DIAGNOSIS OF ISCHEMIC HEART DISEASE DETERMINED BY FRACTIONAL FLOW RESERVE 

This comparative study shows that positron emission tomography (PET), using 15O-water as a tracer, exhibits the highest accuracy for diagnosis of myocardial ischemia. 

QUANTITATIVE ASSESSMENT OF MYOCARDIAL PERFUSION IN THE DETECTION OF SIGNIFICANT CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE 

	This study examines the cutoff values for absolute MBF and to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of quantitative 15O-water positron emission tomography (PET). It concludes that the use of 15O-water in PET provides high diagnostic performance for quantitative MBF measurements.

First CE Mark for Patient Kits as Medical Devices Obtained by MedTrace 

CEO Ann Kristin Led and CTO Lars Trolle in front of MedTrace’s automated manufacturing system (P3 MT-100) that produces, doses, and injects 15O-water. The now CE marked Patient Kits connect the P3 MT-100 to the patient via a venflon.

MedTrace recently gained its first CE mark for two of its medical devices less than 12 months after submitting the technical file. Obtaining the European CE mark demonstrates the company’s commitment and ability to successfully and in a short time bring a product from research and development to a commercial launch, says Senior Director of QA & RA at MedTrace, Maja Damby Carøe.

With great anticipation, MedTrace reveals today that the company has obtained the MDR Certification and its first CE mark for its patient kits.

The medical devices are part of MedTrace’s automated manufacturing solution for producing, dosing, and injecting 15O-water to patients during PET exams.

Senior Director of QA & RA at MedTrace, Maja Damby Carøe, says:

“I am immensely proud of our achievement. Receiving the MDR Certificate and the first CE mark proves that MedTrace has the team and processes in place to generate extensive technical documentation, solve complex uncertainties in due time, and finally achieve market clearance for medical devices.”

“As a young pharma and medical device company, the first CE mark is a major advancement for us and the groundwork is now laid for the market clearance of our entire 15O-water solution,” says Maja Damby Carøe.

The now CE marked Patient Kits connect the company’s automated manufacturing system (P3 MT-100) to the patient via a venflon. The Patient Kits along with the P3 MT-100, are currently in use at several university hospitals in the U.S. and Europe as part of the company’s phase III clinical trial. 

Market Clearance of aQuant is Expected Next

MedTrace is also in the final stages of developing its evaluation software, aQuant. It is expected that this software will offer analysis of the quantitative myocardial blood flow during PET exams with 15O-water. MedTrace anticipates celebrating aQuant as its next market clearance achievement. 

Pharma and medical device company MedTrace focus on radiopharmaceuticals with an ultra-short half-life and is currently working to make 15O-water available in clinical practice. The company has an ongoing phase III clinical trial that seeks to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy and safety of  15O-water as a myocardial perfusion PET imaging agent.

MedTrace recently celebrated that it had activated four new U.S. sites, bringing the total number to six activated sites across Denmark and the U.S.

The company has offices north of Copenhagen, Denmark, and in Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA.

The First Scientific Article Based on a MedTrace-Sponsored Study Has Been Published 

MedTrace is proud to see the methodology paper “Rationale and design of the RAPID-WATER-FLOW trial: Radiolabeled perfusion to identify coronary artery disease using water to evaluate responses of myocardial FLOW” published in Journal of Nuclear Cardiology (2024) vol. 31. The article is authored, among others, by Principal Investigator of the trial Marcelo F. Di Carli and it is the first scientific publication to come from a MedTrace-sponsored study.

The Phase III clinical trial RAPID-WATER-FLOW aims to test the diagnostic performance of 15O-water PET MPI to detect clinically significant epicardial coronary artery disease (CAD), while also addressing and improving on some of the limitations of the 15O-water tracer.

While the methodology paper of the trial is published in Journal of Nuclear Cardiology (2024) vol. 31, the trial is also the center of attention in an editorial in the same issue by Anisiia Crowley, MD, and Myron Gerson, MD, titled “The future of PET imaging: Looking forward to more choices and increased precision with the use of oxygen-15 water.”  

The two authors discuss the limitations and possible benefits of both the RAPID-WATER-FLOW trial and 15O-water in general, and MedTrace is pleased to read that they look forward to the results of the trial, as Crowley and Gerson writes:

“The design [of RAPID-WATER-FLOW] is exciting and innovative with clear potential to advance cardiac imaging.”

At MedTrace, Emily Vandenbroucke, Senior Director of Clinical Affairs, comments on the editorial:  

“I appreciated that Crowley and Gerson specifically highlighted the use of fractional flow reserve (FFR) and instantaneous wave-free ratio (iFR) as a “more clinically precise” truth standard for moderate stenoses, and how the study design will ultimately result in a “more accurate and generalizable description of the diagnostic performance of oxygen-15 water imaging.”  We are proud of these inclusions in the study design. As the authors point out, we also incorporate myocardial blood flow quantification as part of the blinded assessment of the oxygen-15 water images.”

“I too look forward to seeing the results of the RAPID-WATER-FLOW trial as we hope it will pave the way for making MedTrace’s PET point-of-care solution available in clinical practice to the benefit of patients and healthcare professionals,” says Emily Vandenbroucke.

Shrinking the Manufacturing Footprint with PET Point-of-Care 

Jared Driskill, Sr. Medical Advisor at MedTrace

“Today, most PET radiopharmaceuticals are produced at centralized locations and distributed. However, there are logistical limitations to this model and that is why it becomes increasingly interesting, and perhaps important, to consider point-of-care manufacturing.” 

– Jared Driskill, Senior Medical Advisor at MedTrace, in the January 2024 edition of the SNMMI Value Initiative Newsletter.  

The Value Initiative is SNMMI’s (Society of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging’s) strategic vision and roadmap for working with the industry and other partners to advance the crucial role of nuclear medicine, molecular imaging, and radiopharmaceutical therapy to the medical community, regulators, patients, and the public.

In the article “The Future of PET Point-of-Care Manufacturing – Interview with Jared Driskill, Sr. Medical Advisor at MedTrace”, Driskill shares his insights on where the field is headed and what challenges manufacturers and regulators must overcome before PET point-of-care manufacturing can be made available in clinical practice.

“The industry stakeholders in this space, including MedTrace, are now investigating how we might shrink the entire PET radiopharmaceutical manufacturing footprint and put it in a ‘box’ placed right at the point of patient care. The challenge here is that the drug manufacturer will, of course, be held accountable for everything that goes on within this box, and to the same caliber of standards as those expected from a more traditional PET manufacturing facility. It is a regulatory challenge, but it will be fun to figure all of that out!” Jared Driskill says.

Driskill has spent more than 25 years working in the nuclear medicine and imaging arena. As Sr. Medical Advisor at MedTrace, he is currently occupied with the company’s Phase III Clinical Trial which seeks to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy and safety of 15O-water as a myocardial perfusion PET imaging agent.

Article in the January 2024 edition of the SNMMI Value Initiative Newsletter:

The Future of PET Point-of-Care Manufacturing

Interview with Jared Driskill, Sr. Medical Advisor at MedTrace

You’ve worked in the nuclear medicine and imaging arena for more than 25 years. What do you see as the biggest challenges for making PET point-of-care manufacturing available in clinical practice?

Today, most PET radiopharmaceuticals are produced at centralized locations and distributed. However, there are logistical limitations to this model and that is why it becomes increasingly interesting, and perhaps important, to consider point-of-care manufacturing. The industry stakeholders in this space, including MedTrace, are now investigating how we might shrink the entire PET radiopharmaceutical manufacturing footprint and put it in a “box” placed right at the point of patient care. The challenge here is that the drug manufacturer will, of course, be held accountable for everything that goes on within this box, and to the same caliber of standards as those expected from a more traditional PET manufacturing facility. It is a regulatory challenge, but it will be fun to figure all of that out! Based on ongoing conversations with both regulatory authorities and other manufacturers of ultra-short half-life PET radiopharmaceuticals, the interest in pursuing solutions to these challenges appears to be gaining momentum. Some of these concepts, as outlined in a recently posted FDA discussion paper (Distributed Manufacturing and Point-of-Care Manufacturing of Drugs), were also entertained at the November 2023 FDA PET Drugs Workshop (co-organized by the FDA, SNMMI, MITA, and the Coalition of PET Drug Manufacturers).

Tell us more about that. How do you see PET point-of-care manufacturing influencing the future of imaging?

Things are becoming really interesting as more institutions are beginning to offer whole-body PET/CT imaging. I think by combining the ability to produce ultra-short half-life PET radiopharmaceuticals at the point-of-care with the capacity to perform whole-body PET/CT imaging, we will begin to see correlatives that have never been seen before. What if we had the ability to perfuse multiple organs, look at blood flow throughout the body, and quantify it all in one imaging session? And by using ultra-short half-life PET isotopes, perhaps we may even be able to get multiple serial infusions and images under different conditions back-to-back while the patient remains in the scanner.

From a practical point of view, I think we can certainly see some advantages regarding patient throughput and department flow as there are no drug distribution and delivery constraints with an on-site manufacturing point-of-care model. To say the least, it can be challenging to keep an imaging department on schedule when having to rely on just-in-time delivery of radiopharmaceuticals from a centralized manufacturer, but for a facility who has the ability to manufacture PET radiopharmaceuticals on-site, perhaps your schedule becomes a little more robust, a little more flexible. So, I think that’s the essence of point-of-care practicality. We have the opportunity to re-think the radiopharmaceutical distribution model and its limitations, including the need for longer half-life isotopes, while enjoying some of the advantages point-of-care manufacturing affords, such as flexibility in novel imaging protocols and departmental flows.

What kind of timeline are we looking at in terms of having PET point-of-care manufacturing available in clinical practice?

I won’t speculate on the timing, but I can say that we at MedTrace are tirelessly working to make point-of-care manufacturing for ultra-short half-life radioisotopes practically available and a real possibility! We are certainly hoping to see favorable results from our ongoing Phase 3 trial and welcome the additional work it would create as we seek regulatory approval for 15O-water along with the P3 point-of-care manufacturing system.

MedTrace has an automated manufacturing system, P3 MT-100, which is in use at several hospitals around the world as part of the company’s Phase 3 Clinical Trial, which seeks to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy and safety of  15O-water as a myocardial perfusion PET imaging agent.

Based in Denmark, Sweden, and the US, we are a team of diverse ages, cultures, and professional backgrounds.

Our company is collaborating with university hospitals in Europe, Japan, and the USA to develop and test our products. This is part of preparing our solution for regulatory approval in various regions of the world. 

How we got started 

Our co-founder Rune Wiik Kristensen wondered why 15O-water, the gold standard for perfusion imaging, was not in routine clinical use. Rune, who had worked as a radiochemist in two of Denmark’s top hospitals, also wondered why cardiac PET (position emission tomography) wasn´t on the radar of most clinicians in the field, given the great success of oncological PET.

He learned that 15O-water was impractical in a clinical setting because it had such a short half-life, rendering the supply chain near impossible to scale up. Yet he also deduced that the short half-life, if controlled, would provide for reduced patient dosage and shorter scan times, increasing the feasibility of cardiac PET.

Rune decided to try to invent a device that would allow 15O-water to be produced right next to a PET scanner in a hospital, overcoming the short half-life and making 15O-water practically available. 

Sketched on a dinner napkin 

About this time, Rune met MedTrace’s other co-founder, Martin Stenfeldt. Martin was an independent executive consultant who helped companies draw up and develop their business plans.

Martin became enthusiastic about the potential for 15O-water in a clinical setting. The two had lunch together in a restaurant in Vejle, Denmark, and sketched out the idea for MedTrace on a dinner napkin.

Peter Larsen, an experienced inventor of chemistry devices, was approached to help create the physical device that would manufacture and infuse 15O-water next to the patient in a PET scanner, and thus became the third co-founder.

The new company was born, and officially registered in January 2015. The result was MedTrace’s P3 system, now installed at several hospitals. More than 1,000 patients have been scanned clinically with the help of the P3 system. 

Creating software for 15O-water diagnosis 

Meanwhile, Mark Lubberink, a Dutch physicist, was working with his PhD student Hans Harms to create analytical software that would analyze 15O-water PET images. Mark relocated to Uppsala University Hospital (Sweden) where he met Professor Jens Soerensen, a Dane working in Uppsala. Professor Soerensen helped Hans find funding to work further on the project in Aarhus, Denmark, where he met Lars Poulsen Tolbod, a hospital physicist.

Together, they created the novel analysis software that became aQuant, which delivers a variety of clear images of the area scanned while it quantifies blood flow to allow for accurate diagnosis. 

The two groups met by coincidence at an industry conference in San Diego and realized that their products complimented each other perfectly. After feedback from multiple potential investors, the decision was made to merge the two companies under the common name MedTrace Pharma in August 2018, although aQuant remains the brand name of the software.

Since then, the company has continued to grow, and is now considered a development stage company with beginning revenue. 

In December 2020, Aarhus University Hospital received a magistral exemption for clinical use of MedTrace’s P3 system as well as the required medical device exemptions related to the P3 system. Since then, the Danish Medicines Agency has granted exemption for any kind of clinical perfusion studies using the P3 system and the aQuant analytical software.

At the Series B financing round in May 2021, MedTrace attracted a strong syndication of investors in the form of ATP, BankInvest and Vækstfonden from Denmark, Swisscanto Private Equity from Switzerland and the European Innovation Council. In September 2021, MedTrace was granted US patent 16349.238 for its system for modelling the human heart.

MedTrace will move in 2022 to larger premises in Hørsholm near Copenhagen that will include a showroom and shop featuring MedTrace hardware and software. In addition, MedTrace will start building its US operations in 2022 out of Medical Alley near Minneapolis, MN.

Shrinking the Manufacturing Footprint with PET Point-of-Care 

Jared Driskill, Sr. Medical Advisor at MedTrace

“Today, most PET radiopharmaceuticals are produced at centralized locations and distributed. However, there are logistical limitations to this model and that is why it becomes increasingly interesting, and perhaps important, to consider point-of-care manufacturing.” 

– Jared Driskill, Senior Medical Advisor at MedTrace, in the January 2024 edition of the SNMMI Value Initiative Newsletter.  

The Value Initiative is SNMMI’s (Society of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging’s) strategic vision and roadmap for working with the industry and other partners to advance the crucial role of nuclear medicine, molecular imaging, and radiopharmaceutical therapy to the medical community, regulators, patients, and the public.

In the article “The Future of PET Point-of-Care Manufacturing – Interview with Jared Driskill, Sr. Medical Advisor at MedTrace”, Driskill shares his insights on where the field is headed and what challenges manufacturers and regulators must overcome before PET point-of-care manufacturing can be made available in clinical practice.

“The industry stakeholders in this space, including MedTrace, are now investigating how we might shrink the entire PET radiopharmaceutical manufacturing footprint and put it in a ‘box’ placed right at the point of patient care. The challenge here is that the drug manufacturer will, of course, be held accountable for everything that goes on within this box, and to the same caliber of standards as those expected from a more traditional PET manufacturing facility. It is a regulatory challenge, but it will be fun to figure all of that out!” Jared Driskill says.

Driskill has spent more than 25 years working in the nuclear medicine and imaging arena. As Sr. Medical Advisor at MedTrace, he is currently occupied with the company’s Phase III Clinical Trial which seeks to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy and safety of 15O-water as a myocardial perfusion PET imaging agent.

Article in the January 2024 edition of the SNMMI Value Initiative Newsletter:

The Future of PET Point-of-Care Manufacturing

Interview with Jared Driskill, Sr. Medical Advisor at MedTrace

You’ve worked in the nuclear medicine and imaging arena for more than 25 years. What do you see as the biggest challenges for making PET point-of-care manufacturing available in clinical practice?

Today, most PET radiopharmaceuticals are produced at centralized locations and distributed. However, there are logistical limitations to this model and that is why it becomes increasingly interesting, and perhaps important, to consider point-of-care manufacturing. The industry stakeholders in this space, including MedTrace, are now investigating how we might shrink the entire PET radiopharmaceutical manufacturing footprint and put it in a “box” placed right at the point of patient care. The challenge here is that the drug manufacturer will, of course, be held accountable for everything that goes on within this box, and to the same caliber of standards as those expected from a more traditional PET manufacturing facility. It is a regulatory challenge, but it will be fun to figure all of that out! Based on ongoing conversations with both regulatory authorities and other manufacturers of ultra-short half-life PET radiopharmaceuticals, the interest in pursuing solutions to these challenges appears to be gaining momentum. Some of these concepts, as outlined in a recently posted FDA discussion paper (Distributed Manufacturing and Point-of-Care Manufacturing of Drugs), were also entertained at the November 2023 FDA PET Drugs Workshop (co-organized by the FDA, SNMMI, MITA, and the Coalition of PET Drug Manufacturers).

Tell us more about that. How do you see PET point-of-care manufacturing influencing the future of imaging?

Things are becoming really interesting as more institutions are beginning to offer whole-body PET/CT imaging. I think by combining the ability to produce ultra-short half-life PET radiopharmaceuticals at the point-of-care with the capacity to perform whole-body PET/CT imaging, we will begin to see correlatives that have never been seen before. What if we had the ability to perfuse multiple organs, look at blood flow throughout the body, and quantify it all in one imaging session? And by using ultra-short half-life PET isotopes, perhaps we may even be able to get multiple serial infusions and images under different conditions back-to-back while the patient remains in the scanner.

From a practical point of view, I think we can certainly see some advantages regarding patient throughput and department flow as there are no drug distribution and delivery constraints with an on-site manufacturing point-of-care model. To say the least, it can be challenging to keep an imaging department on schedule when having to rely on just-in-time delivery of radiopharmaceuticals from a centralized manufacturer, but for a facility who has the ability to manufacture PET radiopharmaceuticals on-site, perhaps your schedule becomes a little more robust, a little more flexible. So, I think that’s the essence of point-of-care practicality. We have the opportunity to re-think the radiopharmaceutical distribution model and its limitations, including the need for longer half-life isotopes, while enjoying some of the advantages point-of-care manufacturing affords, such as flexibility in novel imaging protocols and departmental flows.

What kind of timeline are we looking at in terms of having PET point-of-care manufacturing available in clinical practice?

I won’t speculate on the timing, but I can say that we at MedTrace are tirelessly working to make point-of-care manufacturing for ultra-short half-life radioisotopes practically available and a real possibility! We are certainly hoping to see favorable results from our ongoing Phase 3 trial and welcome the additional work it would create as we seek regulatory approval for 15O-water along with the P3 point-of-care manufacturing system.

MedTrace has an automated manufacturing system, P3 MT-100, which is in use at several hospitals around the world as part of the company’s Phase 3 Clinical Trial, which seeks to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy and safety of  15O-water as a myocardial perfusion PET imaging agent.

Semi-automated software for 15O-water PET myocardial blood flow analysis 

IMPORTANT NOTICE: MedTrace’s products are not currently cleared for routine use in any markets, including both the US and Europe. In the US, 15O-water is currently under investigation as an investigational drug in a Phase 3 clinical trial. In Europe, its use is in compliance with approvals granted by national drug authorities, in accordance with the specific legislation of each member state. 

aQuant is a software suited for the semi-automated and robust analysis of 15O-water. The underlying algorithms of aQuant have been used in research and reported in more than 30 peer-reviewed articles over the last decade. 

Each 15O-water scan is segmented using Cluster Analysis, automatically extracting the blood input function. 

aQuant is a semi-automated software that provides high quality quantitative images of bloodflow, which use to be a challenge for 15O-water. 

Automated generated result ready for manual QC. 

Results of MBF at stress and rest are presented as short and long axis images, polarmaps and in tabular form. Build-in quality control helps the reviewer assess the quality of the scan. 

Results are summarized on a report page and can be exported to local PACS system. Parametric images can likewise be exported for documentation or subsequent fusion with CT angiogram. 

Images of anonym’s kindly provided by Prof. Jens Sörensen, Uppsala University Hospital. 

These input functions are then further used to generate diagnostic images using 15O-water’s simple kinetic model. The high-contrast images of Perfusable Tissue Fraction (PTF) are then used for automated segmentation of the heart itself. Since PTF does not represent blood flow, this eliminates observer bias in low-blood flow regions. 

	By automatic generation, reorientation and segmentation of quantitative parametric images of blood flow, results
are ready for review with hardly any user interaction necessary.

G. Data ProcessorsMedTrace uses Data Processors to host personal data and to support our use of systems.

In relation to clinical trial subjects, MedTrace uses a Data Processor, Cardiovascular Clinical Studies located in Boston, USA, to manage the clinical trials (a “Contract Research Organizations” or “CRO”). The CRO will in many cases also use processors (e.g. “Principal Investigators”).

H. Transfer of personal dataIn some cases, MedTrace transfers personal data to Data processors, to the MedTrace website, to public authorities or to external legal advisors and accountants.

I. Transfer to third countries

In some situations, MedTrace transfers personal data to countries outside of the EU/EEA countries, currently to the US.

IMPORTANT NOTICE: MedTrace’s products are not currently cleared for routine use in any markets, including both the US and Europe. In the US, 15O-water is currently under investigation as an investigational drug in a Phase 3 clinical trial. In Europe, its use is in compliance with approvals granted by national drug authorities, in accordance with the specific legislation of each member state. 

MedTrace is dedicated to becoming a global leader in perfusion imaging. Our products are under development and are being designed to help patients be diagnosed quickly and accurately.

Our goal is to innovate PET diagnostic imaging by transforming blood flow quantification. We will do this by making 15O-water PET practically available in clinical settings.

Based in Denmark and the US, we are a team of diverse ages, cultures, and professional backgrounds.

Our company is collaborating with university hospitals in Europe, Japan, and the USA to develop and test our products. This is part of preparing our solution for regulatory approval in various regions of the world. 

How we got started 

Our co-founder Rune Wiik Kristensen wondered why 15O-water is considered the gold standard3 for perfusion imaging, but it was not used routinely clinically. Rune, who had worked as a radiochemist in two of Denmark’s top hospitals, also wondered why cardiac PET (position emission tomography) wasn’t on the radar of most clinicians in the field, given the great success of oncological PET.

He learned that 15O-water was impractical in a clinical setting because it had such a short half-life, rendering the supply chain near impossible to scale up. Yet he also deduced that the short half-life, if controlled, would provide for reduced patient dosage and shorter scan times, increasing the feasibility of cardiac PET.

Rune decided to try to invent a device that would allow 15O-water to be produced right next to a PET scanner in a hospital, overcoming the short half-life and making 15O-water practically available. 

Sketched on a dinner napkin 

About this time, Rune met MedTrace’s other co-founder, Martin Stenfeldt. Martin was an independent executive consultant who helped companies draw up and develop their business plans.

Martin became enthusiastic about the potential for 15O-water in a clinical setting. The two had lunch together in a restaurant in Vejle, Denmark, and sketched out the idea for MedTrace on a dinner napkin.

Peter Larsen, an experienced inventor of chemistry devices, was approached to help create the physical device that would manufacture and infuse 15O-water next to the patient in a PET scanner, and thus became the third co-founder.

The new company was born, and officially registered in January 2015. The result was the development of MedTrace’s P3 system. As of August 2023 more than 3000 patients have been clinically scanned in Denmark with MedTrace system. 

Creating software for 15O-water diagnosis 

Meanwhile, Hans Harms, a Dutch PhD student was working under supervision of the Dutch physicist, Mark Lubberink to create analytical software that could analyze 15O-water PET images. Mark relocated to Uppsala University Hospital (Sweden) where he met Professor Jens Soerensen, a Dane working in Uppsala. Professor Soerensen helped Hans find funding to work further on the project in Aarhus, Denmark, where he met Lars Poulsen Tolbod, a hospital physicist.

Together, they created the novel analysis software that became aQuant, which aims to deliver a variety of clear images of the area scanned while it quantifies blood flow to enhance diagnostic abilities of the clinician. 

The two groups met by coincidence at an industry conference in San Diego and realized that their products complimented each other perfectly. After feedback from multiple potential investors, the decision was made to merge the two companies under the common name MedTrace Pharma in August 2018.

Since then, the company has continued to grow, and is now considered a development stage company with beginning revenue. 

In December 2020, Aarhus University Hospital received a magistral exemption for clinical use of MedTrace’s P3 system as well as authorization for the use of non-CE marked medical device components of the P3 system. Since then, the Danish Medicines Agency has granted exemption for clinical perfusion studies using the P3 system and the aQuant analytical software at Aarhus University hospital and Copenhagen University hospital. Aarhus University Hospital has scanned more than 3000 patients using the MedTrace P3 system.

At the Series B financing round in May 2021, MedTrace attracted a strong syndication of investors in the form of ATP, BankInvest and Vækstfonden from Denmark, Swisscanto Private Equity from Switzerland and the European Innovation Council. MedTrace finished a new series of funding in September 2023 primary based on the existing investor group.

MedTrace has since 2021 received 16 patents within 4 different “patentfamilies” here among its system for modelling the human heart in EP, JP, US, CN.

MedTrace moved to its existing premises in DTU Sciencepark in Hørsholm near Copenhagen that includes showroom featuring hardware and software. In Sept. 2022 MedTrace opened its US office out of Medical Alley in Minneapolis, MN.

aQuant

Core Values
Investors, Grants & Awards

Automated software for 15O-water PET myocardial blood flow analysis. 

aQuant is a software suite for the automated and robust analysis of 15O-water. The underlying algorithms of aQuanthave been used in more than 30 peer-reviewed studies over the last decade. aQuant is currently not approved bythe FDA, and is not CE-marked. 

Each 15O-water scan is segmented using Cluster Analysis, automatically extracting the blood input function. 

	By automatic generation, reorientation and segmentation of quantitative parametric images of blood flow, results
are ready for review with hardly any user interaction necessary.	

Results of MBF at stress and rest as well as Coronary Flow Reserve are presented as short and long axis images, polarmaps and in tabular form. Color coding helps the reader identify abnormal segments and defect size. Perfusable Tissue Index (PTI), a fibrosis index unique to 15O-water, is presented in a similar fashion. Build-in quality control helps the reviewer assess the quality of the scan. 

Results are summarized on a report page and can be exported to local PACS system as a DICOM image. Parametric images can likewise be exported as DICOM images for documentation or subsequent fusion with CT angiogram.

Historically, the analysis of 15O-water was challenging due to high noise levels and low contrast. The introduction of PET/CT has greatly improved image quality, enabling a routine use of 15O-water. However, the low contrast remains, complicating analysis. Analyzing 15O-water therefore requires a different approach than normal: we first need to generate contrast. 

These input functions are then further used to generate diagnostic images using 15O-water’s simple kinetic model. The high-contrast images of Perfusable Tissue Fraction (PTF) are then used for automated segmentation of the heart itself. Since PTF does not represent blood flow, this eliminates observer bias in low-blood flow regions. 

	By automatic generation, reorientation and segmentation of quantitative parametric images of blood flow, results
are ready for review with hardly any user interaction necessary.

MedTrace Pharma Announces First Subject Scanned in the Company’s RAPID-WATER-FLOW Phase 3 Clinical Trial 

First Subject Scanned in RAPID-WATER-FLOW Trial at Aarhus University Hospital, DenmarkMultiple Sites Involved Across the United States, Denmark, Sweden, and The NetherlandsThe Global Trial is Expected to Continue for 12 Months

MedTrace Pharma A/S, a pharma and device company and an innovator in PET diagnostic imaging, announced today that it has scanned the first subject in its RAPID-WATER-FLOW Phase 3 clinical trial.

The global trial enrolls adults with suspected Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) and seeks to evaluate the use of 15O-water PET in diagnosing CAD.

The first subject scan took place at Aarhus University Hospital (AUH) in Denmark just two months after MedTrace received FDA approval of the company’s Investigational New Drug (IND) application and the approval to commence the trial. 

Marcelo Di Carli, MD, Professor of Radiology and Medicine, at Brigham and Women’s Hospital and Harvard Medical School, is leading the trial as Principal Investigator.

– I am thrilled by the recruitment of the first subjects into the RAPID-WATER-FLOW study. This is a significant milestone for this exciting and important study and the first step towards bringing 15O-water as a clinical myocardial perfusion agent in the United States. The practical real-time production of 15O-water with MedTrace’s novel technology promises to revolutionize the practice of cardiac PET imaging by improving patient access to the most accurate approach to the non-invasive diagnosis of coronary artery disease, says Marcelo DiCarli.

15O-water at the point of careMedTrace’s technology automatically produces and administers15O-water to patients at the point of care. The automated software solution also provided by MedTrace (aQuant, in development) makes available a fully quantitative as well as visual 15O-water image analysis, including quantification of blood flow and segmental perfusion data, aiming to allow healthcare professionals to diagnose patients accurately and quickly.

The innovative solution allows for absolute blood flow imaging and quantification based upon the PET tracer 15O-water, which has long been acknowledged as the gold standard tracer for quantitative myocardial perfusion imaging. 

Hospitals produce the radioactivity themselves on demand and are not dependent on third-party suppliers for radiopharmaceuticals. 

Lars Christian Gormsen, Consultant, Professor at the Department of Nuclear Medicine & PET Center at AUH is the PI for the trial at AUH and is happy to be the first site to enroll a subject in this milestone study.

– Thanks to the excellent work by our colleagues at the Department of Cardiology and the staff at the department of Nuclear Medicine, the recruitment and subsequent examination of the first patient in the project progressed as planned. We are confident that this will also be the case in the remaining part of the project, says Lars Christian Gormsen.

At MedTrace the first subject enrolled is celebrated throughout the organization.

– I am beyond impressed with the dedication from the MedTrace clinical team and from our partners at AUH. They made it possible to reach this significant milestone in less than two months after we received the green light from the FDA. It shows that our company is moving at an incredible pace which is made possible by the talented and passionate people onboard, says Martin Stenfeldt, CEO of MedTrace.

The company is currently exploring clinical applications outside of cardiology and looking into research areas such as oncology and neurology. MedTrace’s clinical department will be growing significantly by the end of the year.

About the RAPID-WATER-FLOW Trials

The trial is a Phase 3, prospective, open-label, multicenter study of 15O-H2O injection for PET imaging of subjects with suspected CAD. 182 evaluable participants with suspected CAD will be included in the study at an estimated 10 study sites in the United States and Europe. Approximately 215 participants will be enrolled in total to account for an estimated 15% drop-out rate. All participants will receive two doses of 15O-H2O as part of a single PET imaging session (one dose at rest and one during pharmacological stress with adenosine).

About MedTrace Pharma A/S

Headquartered in Copenhagen, Denmark, MedTrace Pharma A/S was founded in 2015 by Martin Stenfeldt, Rune Wiik Kristensen and Peter Larsen. In 2018 MedTrace merged with the software company aQuant founded by Jens Soerensen, Hendrik (Johannes) Harms, Mark Lubberink, and Lars Poulsen Tolbod that had developed a unique analytic software platform specifically for radioactive water. The company today is a privately held pharmaceutical company focused on PET imaging technologies with a particular emphasis on blood flow and perfusion quantification. The company has a late-stage pipeline including 15O-water as a radiopharmaceutical and aQuant as a medical device software (under development) for the image analysis and quantification of blood flow and perfusion data from cardiac PET scans. In addition to the described trial, the company is pursuing regulatory certification in the EU.

Amongst the company’s key shareholders are The Danish pension fund ATP, SwissCanto Private Equity Invest, The European Innovation Council and BankInvest.
