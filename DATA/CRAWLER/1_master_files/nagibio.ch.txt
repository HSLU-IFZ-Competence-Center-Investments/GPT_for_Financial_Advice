About worms, NAMs and DART studies at WC12

About worms, NAMs and DART studies at WC12 in Niagara Falls

What a second, NAMs in DART studies? WC12? A bit too much acronyms here. Let’s fix that. NAMs refers to New Approach Methodologies or, using official words: 

“NAMs refer to any technologies, methodologies, approaches, or combinations thereof that can be used to provide information on chemical hazard and potential human exposure that can avoid or significantly reduce the use of testing on animals.” – US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)

Summing up, any method or technology that allows the reduction of animal testing and still provides significant and relevant data for potential adverse effects of substances. Let’s move to the other one: DART or Development And Reproductive Toxicology studies. In order to market any substance/compound, a toxicology assessment has to be done to ensure the safety of humans, animals and the environment. Hence, is the study of adverse effects of substances affecting the normal development or reproductive capabilities of species.

And this is all for today’s blog

Of course not! All this introduction was not done for nothing. The 12th World Congress on Alternatives and Animal Use in the Life Sciences (WC12) is approaching and we have amazing news! Held in the stunning backdrop of Niagara Falls (Canada), the event will bring together experts from all around the world to discuss groundbreaking developments in new approaches, methods, and technologies that propel the 3Rs Principle of Reduce, Refine, Replace animal testing.

And why did we bother you about NAMs and DARTs? Because our CSO and co-founder Laurent Mouchiroud will be presenting our NAMs technology for DART studies during the “21st Century Predictive Toxicology” session. Under the umbrella-theme “New Approach Methodologies for Developmental and Reproductive Toxicity Testing”, Laurent will give a presentation about the “Robotic device for fully automated high-content screening on C. elegans as a novel platform for chemical toxicity assessment”. 

Let’s give you two spoilers: (1) the robotic platform is called SydLab™ One and you can ask him why if you happen to cross him at WC12 (we promise it’s a cool name background), (2) we’ve got a quick glimpse at the data that he will present and it’s truly fascinating.

Fancy a sneak peek? We brought you a short interview to enlighten your curiosity:

Laurent Mouchiroud, phd: About worms, NAMs and DART studies at WC12

Hello Laurent, thank you for giving us a couple of thoughts about your participation at WC12 in Niagara Falls. Let’s cut to the chase, can you briefly explain the focus of your talk at WC12?

Hello! Certainly. My talk revolves around introducing the organism model C. elegans and its suitability for chemical toxicity assessment. We developed a laboratory platform that is able to exploit the whole potential of C. elegans for high-content screening of substances by automatizing the entire experimentation and results collection process. I am thrilled to show the great results collected by our platform at WC12, proposing it as a novel NAMs for DART studies.

Fascinating! Let’s not spoil your talk anymore. Remind us, which day and time will it take place?

It’s Monday, August 28th, Session #450 at 14:00 (GMT-4). See you there and do not hesitate to come and have a chat with me afterwards!

Thank you Laurent. To conclude this short interview, what do you expect from WC12 and what are you most excited about?

Thank you for having me. I’m truly looking forward to WC12 and the opportunity it presents to connect with fellow scientists and regulators working for alternatives to animal testing and animal welfare. Conferences like these are invaluable platforms for engaging in meaningful discussions, sharing insights, and learning about the latest advancements, needs, and trends in predictive toxicology. I’m excited to be a part of a community that is driving innovation towards more ethical and efficient testing methods, and sharing the technology we developed at Nagi is an amazing milestone for us. My main goal is to immerse myself in the discussions, gain fresh perspectives, and contribute to the collective effort of advancing science. It’s these interactions and collaborations that truly inspire progress, and I’m eager to be a part of that energy at WC12.

Interested in knowing more? Have a chat with Laurent at WC12

Failure in later stages of the R&D pipeline is especially costly. We actively pursue technologies to identify adverse toxicology as early as possible, such as Nagi Bioscience’s technologies.

Early Toxicology Safety – Agrochemical Company

Unfavorable toxicological profiles are a major cause of late failure in our discovery pipelines. Failure in later stages of the R&D pipeline is especially costly. We are actively pursuing technologies to identify adverse toxicology as early as possible, including through the use of model systems such as those being investigated by Nagi Bioscience.

Early Toxicology Safety – Agrochemical Company

Methodologies to assess lifespan and healthspan measures in a high-throughput manner are currently inadequate in the C. elegans field. The integration of Nagi’s technology opened many possibilities for us as a company.

CEO – Aging Biotech Company

Before proceeding to clinical trials, the efficacy of our existing drugs or combinations thereof for their positive impact on healthspan will be tested in the nematode C.elegans. However, methodologies to assess lifespan and healthspan measures in a high-throughput manner are currently inadequate in the C. elegans field. The integration of Nagi’s technology into Rejuvenate opened many possibilities for us as a company.

A ‘Parts List’ for cancer’s spread: Worms to fight metastasis

A ‘Parts List’ for cancer’s spread: Worms to fight metastasis

Cancer metastasis, the process in which cancer cells spread throughout the body, is a major challenge in cancer treatment and the leading cause of cancer-related deaths. Understanding how cancer cells break through tissue barriers and invade other organs is crucial for developing effective treatments. In a recent groundbreaking study, researchers at Duke University have utilized our favorite nematode C. elegans to create a comprehensive “parts list” of the cellular machinery involved in invasive cell behavior. The researchers stated that their work could potentially lead to new strategies for preventing cancer metastasis in humans.

The mystery of cancer metastasis

Metastasis is the process by which cancer cells detach from the primary tumor, penetrate the surrounding tissue, and migrate to distant organs. While numerous anti-cancer drugs have been developed, only a few effectively prevent metastasis, which is responsible for a staggering 90% of cancer deaths (Spano et al., 2012). The difficulty in studying this process lies in its unpredictability and the fact that cancer cells often metastasize to deep regions of the body, making them challenging to observe using conventional methods, such as light microscopes.

What does a tiny nematode have to say about cancer?

A while ago we already dedicated a blog post about C. elegans nematodes and their role in cancer research. In said article we highlighted that due to their relative simplicity (less gene families), genetic redundancy is reduced and it helps to unveil certain biological mechanisms that could potentially be translated into other animals and humans. Deregulation of energy metabolism, stem cell reprogramming and host-microflora interactions are some of the multiple cancer research lines that use our favorite nematode.

But what about metastasis? To overcome the challenges of studying cancer metastasis, the research team used C. elegans worms as they present a similar invasive process during their development. The worm possesses specialized cells called anchor cells that must break through a tough membrane to create a path for egg-laying. By studying this invasion process in C. elegans, researchers aimed to uncover the molecular mechanisms involved in cell invasion.

Unveiling the ‘Parts List’ of invasion

In their study, the scientists analyzed millions of transcriptomes (gene readouts) from invading worm cells to identify the genes and proteins responsible for invasion. They discovered approximately 1,500 genes that were significantly more active in invasive cells compared to other cells in the worm’s body. This comprehensive profile allowed the researchers to compile a catalog or ‘parts list’ of the cellular components necessary for invasion. 

A key finding was the increased activity of genes encoding ribosomes, the cellular machinery responsible for protein synthesis. The researchers observed a surge in ribosome levels leading up to invasion, indicating the importance of protein production in facilitating invasion. By silencing specific genes related to ribosome production, the researchers observed a slowdown in invasive cell behavior.

This pioneering research offers crucial insights into the invasive behavior of cells, potentially paving the way for new strategies to impede cancer metastasis. By targeting combinations of genes that are involved in ribosome production and disrupting the supply chain necessary for invasion, researchers hope to develop novel approaches to halt cancer spread. 

Cancer is still the second leading cause of death worldwide after heart disease (Global Health Estimates, 2016), and metastasis poses a significant challenge in the treatment of it. The study conducted by researchers at Duke University, employing C. elegans worms, has provided valuable insights into the molecular machinery underlying invasive cell behavior. This study represents a significant step forward in our understanding of cancer progression and offers hope for improved treatments and outcomes for cancer patients.

Furthermore, the scientists used fluorescent tagging to visualize the ribosomes and found that they congregated in an organelle called the endoplasmic reticulum, where protein synthesis and packaging occur. This clustering of ribosomes suggested a cellular strategy to boost protein production in preparation for invasion.

About Us

the people behind our technology

SHAPING THE FUTURE OF BIOLOGICAL TESTING TOGETHER

We are a spin-off from the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne (EPFL), founded in Switzerland in 2019. We provide cutting-edge laboratory equipment for fully automated high-content screening of substances as a 3R alternative to animal testing.

A story of innovation

Everything started when our two founders met and decided to join forces to achieve something never seen before: to create a microfluidic technology that could unlock the potential of microorganisms to speed up research while decreasing the number of animals used in science.

This is the story of the microsystems expert Dr. Matteo Cornaglia (CEO and co-founder) and the biologist and C.elegans expert Dr. Laurent Mouchiroud (CSO and co-founder). 

Since then, the once-dreamt “Organism-on-Chip” field is now a reality that our team has been pioneering over the last decade.

Study of worm disease models

The assay to monitor the effects of test compounds on aggregate formation and aggregation dynamics in numerous C. elegans models of neurodegenerative diseases.

Worms model of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS)​
In vivo monitoring of the hSOD1 aggregates​
Quantification of the size and number of the aggregates during aging​

For this assay we take advantage of the existing C. elegans GFP-reporter strains, modelling a variety of neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, Huntington’s disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), as well as the capacity of SydLab™ One to perform fluorescent imaging. 
A synchronized population of C. elegans is automatically injected into the Nagi™ Chips thanks to SydLab™ One at the first larval stage (L1). Worms are then confined within dedicated microfluidic chambers of the Nagi™ Chips and are continuously fed with an E. coli solution. 
Worms are chronically exposed to the test compounds starting from the last larval stage prior to sexual maturity (L4) for 85 hours (day 3 of adulthood). The entire process of culture and treatment administration is handled by SydLab™ One. The compounds to be tested are mixed with the E. coli solution fed to the worms. Freeze-dried OP50 E. coli are used as a food source for the whole duration of the experiment, preventing the metabolization of the tested molecules by the bacteria.
The images of each microfluidic chamber are recorded every hour by SydLab™ One. Starting from 70 hours post worm injection (day 1 of adulthood), both brightfield and fluorescent images start to be recorded in order to monitor worm growth and protein aggregation dynamics in parallel. Time-resolved phenotypic readouts are then extracted from the collected images in both brightfield and fluorescent modes.

Temporal evolution of the average number of polyQ::yfp aggregates counted per each worm of two different strains: AM140 (C. elegans model for human Huntington’s disease) and AM134 (control strain). “Humanized” C. elegans strains modeling all major neurodegenerative disorders exist, also including e.g. ALS, Alzheimer’s, and Parkinson’s disease. Data obtained by SydLab™ One.

NAGI MOTILITY PHENOTYPES DETeCTION

The assay is designed to evaluate the effects of test compounds on C. elegans behavior and motility, as well as to provide indications about neurotoxicity, muscular toxicity or premature aging process.

A synchronized population of C. elegans is automatically injected into the Nagi™ Chips by the SydLab™ One platform at the first larval stage (L1). Worms are then automatically confined within the dedicated microfluidic chambers inside the Nagi™ Chips and are continuously fed with an E. coli solution (no human intervention needed).
The platform will chronically exposed the worms to the test compounds starting from the last larval stage prior to sexual maturity (L4) for 85 hours (day 3 of adulthood). The compounds to be tested are mixed with the E. coli solution. Freeze-dried OP50 E. coli are used as a food source for the whole duration of the experiment, since it prevents the metabolization of the tested molecules by the bacteria.
Starting from 70 hours post-worm injection (day 1 of adulthood), SydLab™ One will record short video sequences ever 6 hours. Time-resolved readouts are then extracted from the acquired videos for a a diversified characterization of the worms’ motility and behavior thanks to the SydLab™ Analyzer software suite.

BRIDGING THE GAP BETWEEN CELLS AND VERTEBRates

Powerful models for powerful datapoints

Nature’s gift to science

Meet the powerful model organism

Caenorhabditis elegans has been known for more than 60 years as an important exploratory biological model in fundamental research. It helps in addressing various biological questions in the fields of aging, neurobiology, genomics, and developmental and cellular biology. 

A world of possibilities opening up

To this date, large amounts of mutant, transgenic and “humanized” worm strains are available. More specifically, C. elegans is distinguished by its ease of genetic manipulations: single genes can be simply inactivated by feeding the worms with bacteria expressing dsRNA against the gene of interest (RNA interference method). Nowadays, any specific strain can be generated easily “on-demand” using modern CRISPR-Cas9 techniques.

strong relevance & proven translatability to human biology

C. elegans is a well-studied model with useful features for rapid investigations.

Nagi aging research Assays

LIFESPAN PHENOTYPE DETECTION ASSAY

The assay is designed to understand longevity regulation, explore the effects of test compounds on aging, and screen for anti-aging candidates. Bring your research to the next level with unique datapoints.

Synchronized populations of L4 C. elegans larvae are automatically injected into the Nagi™ Chips by the SydLab™ One platform (day 0).
The SydLab System device will continuously expose each worm population to a well-defined liquid environment, including the compounds to be tested and E. coli bacteria as the food source.
Growth and reproduction readouts of C. elegans will be collected and monitored by the system during the first 4 days of adulthood by acquiring brightfield images every hour.
After the first 4 days, SydLab™ One will take videos every 6 hours to analyze multiple motility phenotypes. At this point, the system will also determine whether a worm is alive or not. Consequently, a worm will be considered as dead if no movement is observed for 3+ consecutive video cycles.
The experiment ends when no nematode is alive.

Reproductive parameters
Mean & maximum lifespan

With our analysis software we can extract a multi-phenotypic fingerprint plot including readouts of body bends frequency, velocity, and curvature, as well as amplitude of movement in the head, tail and middle of the body. Data obtained by SydLab™ One.

The worm survival curve is extracted automatically with a 6-hour time resolution, based on the Kaplan-Meier model. The mean lifespan values obtained with our microfluidic platform are therefore consistent with the published literature data. Data obtained by SydLab™ One.

NAGI MOTILITY PHENOTYPES DETeCTION

The assay is designed to evaluate the effects of test compounds on C. elegans behavior and motility, as well as to provide indications about neurotoxicity, muscular toxicity or premature aging process.

A synchronized population of C. elegans is automatically injected into the Nagi™ Chips by the SydLab™ One platform at the first larval stage (L1). Worms are then automatically confined within the dedicated microfluidic chambers inside the Nagi™ Chips and are continuously fed with an E. coli solution (no human intervention needed).
The platform will chronically exposed the worms to the test compounds starting from the last larval stage prior to sexual maturity (L4) for 85 hours (day 3 of adulthood). The compounds to be tested are mixed with the E. coli solution. Freeze-dried OP50 E. coli are used as a food source for the whole duration of the experiment, since it prevents the metabolization of the tested molecules by the bacteria.
Starting from 70 hours post-worm injection (day 1 of adulthood), SydLab™ One will record short video sequences ever 6 hours. Time-resolved readouts are then extracted from the acquired videos for a a diversified characterization of the worms’ motility and behavior thanks to the SydLab™ Analyzer software suite.

In conclusion, this high-content motion analysis reveals very subtle changes in C. elegans movements, beyond average motility measurements. Data obtained by SydLab™ One.

Worms model of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS)​
In vivo monitoring of the hSOD1 aggregates​
Quantification of the size and number of the aggregates during aging​

For this assay we take advantage of the existing C. elegans GFP-reporter strains, modelling a variety of neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, Huntington’s disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), as well as the capacity of SydLab™ One to perform fluorescent imaging. 
A synchronized population of C. elegans is automatically injected into the Nagi™ Chips thanks to SydLab™ One at the first larval stage (L1). Worms are then confined within dedicated microfluidic chambers of the Nagi™ Chips and are continuously fed with an E. coli solution. 
Worms are chronically exposed to the test compounds starting from the last larval stage prior to sexual maturity (L4) for 85 hours (day 3 of adulthood). The entire process of culture and treatment administration is handled by SydLab™ One. The compounds to be tested are mixed with the E. coli solution fed to the worms. Freeze-dried OP50 E. coli are used as a food source for the whole duration of the experiment, preventing the metabolization of the tested molecules by the bacteria.
The images of each microfluidic chamber are recorded every hour by SydLab™ One. Starting from 70 hours post worm injection (day 1 of adulthood), both brightfield and fluorescent images start to be recorded in order to monitor worm growth and protein aggregation dynamics in parallel. Time-resolved phenotypic readouts are then extracted from the collected images in both brightfield and fluorescent modes.

Check the data
Temporal evolution of the average number of polyQ::yfp aggregates counted per each worm of two different strains: AM140 (C. elegans model for human Huntington’s disease) and AM134 (control strain). “Humanized” C. elegans strains modeling all major neurodegenerative disorders exist, also including e.g. ALS, Alzheimer’s, and Parkinson’s disease.

Early Toxicology

Discover the technology behind

Automated early toxicity profiling

toxicity ASSESSMENT HAS NEVER BEEN THAT fast

GET WHOLE-ORGANISM DATA WITHOUT THE USE OF VERTEBRATES.

1 week. 1 experiment.

Toxicity assessment using traditional animal testing can be expensive, time-consuming and subjected to ethical concerns. On the other hand, the use of cell-based models as an alternative for early toxicology tests does not deliver physiological responses and multi-organ crosstalk data.

Bridge the gap between vertebrates and cell models seamlessly with Nagi products. Fast and easy early toxicology assays.

Nagi early Toxicology Assays

The assay to study the potential effects of your molecules on the reproductive capacity using the model organism C. elegans.

A synchronized population of C. elegans is automatically injected into the Nagi™ Chips by the SydLab™ One platform at the first larval stage (L1).
Worms are then automatically confined within dedicated microfluidic chambers inside the Nagi™ Chips and are continuously fed with an E. coli solution (no human intervention needed).
Worms are chronically and automatically exposed to the test compounds starting from the last larval stage prior to sexual maturity (L4) for 85 hours (day 3 of adulthood). The compounds to be tested are mixed with the E. coli solution. Freeze-dried OP50 E. coli are used as a food source for the whole duration of the experiment, preventing the metabolization of the tested molecules by the bacteria.
SydLab™ One records images of each microfluidic chamber every hour. Time-resolved phenotypic readouts are then extracted from the collected images thanks to the SydLab™ Analyzer software suite.

C. elegans reproduction over 96 hours post-hatching for wild-type N2 worms treated with the anticancer drug 5-fluorouracil starting from the L4 larval stage (right) and untreated worms (left) as observed via brightfield imaging by the SydLab™ One. Overlay masks for the detection of worms and eggs are automatically generated by SydLab’s AI-based computer vision algorithm.

Temporal evolution of the average number of larvae produced by wild-type N2 C. elegans treated with the anticancer drug 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) starting from the L4 larval stage vs untreated worms (vehicle). The drug treatment significantly impacts on C.elegans reproductive process. Data provided by SydLab™ One.

Progeny production rate over the first 24 hours of reproduction for wild-type N2 C. elegans treated with the anticancer drug 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) at different doses (data normalized to the value measured for the untreated worm population). 5-fluorouracil treatment specifically affects the worm reproduction, inducing strong embryotoxicity. Data provided by SydLab™ One.

The assay to explore the potential adverse effects of your molecules on the development of C. elegans worms. It can be used as a prediction for teratogenic potency of the test compounds, among other possibilities.

A synchronized population of C. elegans is automatically injected into the Nagi™ Chips by the SydLab™ One laboratory platform at the first larval stage (L1).
Worms are then automatically confined within dedicated microfluidic chambers inside the Nagi™ Chips and are continuously fed with an E. coli solution (no human intervention needed).
Worms are chronically and automatically exposed to the test compounds after the automatized injection (L1 stage) for 130 hours (day 3 of adulthood). The compounds to be tested are mixed with the E. coli solution. Freeze-dried OP50 E. coli are used as a food source for the whole duration of the experiment in order to prevent the metabolization of the tested molecules by the bacteria.
SydLab™ One records images of each microfluidic chamber every hour. Time-resolved phenotypic readouts are then extracted from the collected images thanks to the SydLab™ Analyzer software suite.

C. elegans development over 96 hours post-hatching for wild-type N2 worms treated with the antibiotic doxycycline, starting from the L1 larval stage (right) and untreated worms (left), as observed via brightfield imaging by the SydLab™ One.

Temporal evolution of the average worm size for wild-type N2 C. elegans treated with the antibiotic doxycycline starting from the L1 larval stage vs untreated worms (vehicle). The drug treatment significantly impacts on C. elegans development, size and growth rate. Data provided by SydLab™ One.

Average time to reach half of the maximal size for wild-type N2 C. elegans treated with the antibiotic doxycycline at different doses (data normalized to the value measured for the untreated worm population). Doxycycline treatment significantly impacts on worm development, resulting in growth retardation and reduced size. Data provided by SydLab™ One.

AUTOMATION OF EARLY TOXICITY PROFILING USING C. ELEGANS NEMATODES

C. ELEGANS FOR PREDICTIVE TOXICOLOGY

C. elegans is a well-studied model with useful features for rapid investigations due to its physiological characteristics.
Many pathways important in development, such as reproduction and modes of toxic action, are conserved.
Concordant response areas include growth, development, LD50 ranking and neurotoxicity.

Ref: Hunt et al. (US FDA), 2020

“C. elegans can provide a bridge between in vitro assays and mammalian toxicity testing (…), although standardized culture practices are required to achieve consistent results”

welcome to the sydlab™ one universe

Failure in later stages of the R&D pipeline is especially costly. We actively pursue technologies to identify adverse toxicology as early as possible, such as Nagi Bioscience’s technologies.

Early Toxicology Safety – Agrochemical Company

Unfavorable toxicological profiles are a major cause of late failure in our discovery pipelines. Failure in later stages of the R&D pipeline is especially costly. We are actively pursuing technologies to identify adverse toxicology as early as possible, including through the use of model systems such as those being investigated by Nagi Bioscience.

Early Toxicology Safety – Agrochemical Company

Methodologies to assess lifespan and healthspan measures in a high-throughput manner are currently inadequate in the C. elegans field. The integration of Nagi’s technology opened many possibilities for us as a company.

CEO – Aging Biotech Company

Before proceeding to clinical trials, the efficacy of our existing drugs or combinations thereof for their positive impact on healthspan will be tested in the nematode C.elegans. However, methodologies to assess lifespan and healthspan measures in a high-throughput manner are currently inadequate in the C. elegans field. The integration of Nagi’s technology into Rejuvenate opened many possibilities for us as a company.

Early Toxicology Safety – Agrochemical Company

Unfavorable toxicological profiles are a major cause of late failure in our discovery pipelines. Failure in later stages of the R&D pipeline is especially costly. We are actively pursuing technologies to identify adverse toxicology as early as possible, including through the use of model systems such as those being investigated by Nagi Bioscience.

Early Toxicology Safety – Agrochemical Company

Methodologies to assess lifespan and healthspan measures in a high-throughput manner are currently inadequate in the C. elegans field. The integration of Nagi’s technology opened many possibilities for us as a company.

CEO – Aging Biotech Company

Before proceeding to clinical trials, the efficacy of our existing drugs or combinations thereof for their positive impact on healthspan will be tested in the nematode C.elegans. However, methodologies to assess lifespan and healthspan measures in a high-throughput manner are currently inadequate in the C. elegans field. The integration of Nagi’s technology into Rejuvenate opened many possibilities for us as a company.

Canada takes a step towards ending animal testing

In a significant move towards ethical scientific practices, Canada has taken a decisive step towards ending animal testing to phase out testing of toxic chemicals on animals.

Bill S-5, known as the Strengthening Environmental Protection for a Healthier Canada Act, received royal assent after Senate approval on June 13th, paving the way for the elimination of toxicity testing on animals. This move brings Canada in line with other progressive nations that have already implemented several regulations to end animal testing, such as the famous FDA Modernization Act in the United States last year. The new legislation not only reflects the global shift towards alternative testing methods, but also signals a new era of research and innovation where NAMs (New Approach Methodologies) are key to ensure human-relevant results while reducing the number of animals used in biological research.

The ban and its implications

Toxicity testing has long relied on the use of animals – such as dogs, mice, pigs, fish, and rabbits – to determine the potential harm chemicals may cause to humans. However, animal rights advocates and scientists have highlighted that such tests often fail to correctly assess the safety of those compounds on humans, as well as being ethically questionable when alternatives providing human-relevant data are currently available. Kaitlyn Mitchell, the director of legal advocacy for Animal Justice Canada, expressed her satisfaction with Canada’s commitment to phasing out old-school toxicity assessment methods and ultimately banning animal testing. More than 40 countries have already banned certain forms of animal testing, placing Canada in a position to catch up with global standards.

Canada already introduced early this year the  Budget Implementation Act, which included the ban on cosmetic animal testing and its trade in Canadian territory.

Alternative Testing Methods for toxicity testing

The ban on animal testing in Canada marks a significant shift towards the utilization of non-animal testing methods. These alternative methods – such as computer modeling, 2D and 3D cell models, and micro-organisms testing – offer numerous advantages over traditional animal testing. Those methods are not only less costly and fast than animal testing, but also often provide more human-relevant data while staying cruelty-free.

A current issue that alternative testing methods are facing is how to obtain the full picture with cell models. Hence, how to get the full-organism data necessary to assess organ cross-talk and life-time effects of substances on individuals without animal testing? 

The use of certain microscopic organisms, such as nematodes worms or Drosophila flies, are included in the New Approach Methodologies (NAMs) umbrella. While they still belong to the animal kingdom, they are not sentient and perfect to obtain readouts at the whole-organism level. 

The next question is: can they really predict toxicity in humans? Aren’t they too far from us? The answer: not quite, they are closer to us than you may think. For instance, the most known small organism used in science is C. elegans nematode, a microscopic worm with whom we share 80% of homolog genes.

How similar are C. elegans to humans

Interested in knowing more?

Nagi’s CSO and co-founder Laurent Mouchiroud will give a session at the 12th World Congress on Alternatives and Animal Use in the Life Sciences (WC12) in Canada about New Approach Methodologies for Developmental and Reproductive Toxicity Testing inside the theme “21st Century Predictive Toxicology”.
