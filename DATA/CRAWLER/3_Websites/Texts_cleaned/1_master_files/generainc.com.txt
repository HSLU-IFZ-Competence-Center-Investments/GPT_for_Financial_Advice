UT Center Continues Quest for Low-cost, High-quality Bioenergy

DOE-funded project to study production, processing logistics

KNOXVILLE, TENN. March 21, 2016 – Gasoline and other petroleum-based products are affordable – today – but such was not the case just a few short years ago, and higher prices will likely return in the future. That’s one reason why scientists with the University of Tennessee Center for Renewable Carbon (CRC) continue efforts to develop renewable and cost-competitive biofuels and bio-based products that can be useful for society and to advance rural economies.

The CRC is the lead institution in a $4 million study funded by the U.S. Department of Energy Bioenergy Technologies Office that will allow the CRC and its partners to explore in greater detail some feedstock supply and logistical issues. Partners in the broad-based effort include Auburn University, North Carolina State University and the Idaho National Laboratory. Industry partners Genera Energy, PerkinElmer and Herty Advanced Materials Development Center are all providing guidance regarding the commercial implementation of the harvesting, pre-preprocessing and refining technologies.

“Biorefineries need a guaranteed supply chain, and the research seeks to determine if blending feedstocks could play a role in increasing the performance of feedstock available to biorefineries while lowering the cost,” said Tim Rials, project leader and CRC director. The project is also expected to develop and demonstrate a state-of-the-art biomass processing depot to reduce sources of variation along the supply chain of multiple, high-impact biomass sources and to deliver a consistent feedstock optimized for conversion in different platforms.

Rials says the synergy between the partners and the research infrastructure established by this large project is key to long-term success. “Developing biofuels and bio-based products requires solving a complicated set of scientific and technical problems. You have to be able to grow the different feedstocks efficiently, then harvest and deliver them to biorefineries at a cost that will make it worthwhile to industry to transform the feedstocks into usable industrial products and affordable fuels. Each step from production to harvesting to transportation to chemical conversion presents its own unique challenges, and opportunities to improve the overall system.”

Genera Energy will contribute expertise related to feedstock pre-processing and analyses, including spectroscopic monitoring, at its Vonore, Tenn., facility – the country’s largest and most comprehensive industrial biomass management and processing facility. Genera will employ real-time feedstock monitoring technology to improve feedstock pre-processing. This will enable processing optimization, both in cost and energy consumption, along with an increased dataset on feedstock specifications that reduces variability for the end user. This step will help guarantee potential biorefineries and bioproducts manufacturers will have a consistent and uniform feedstock from which they can refine fuels and other products.

“One barrier to the development of viable biorefineries is the availability of a constant and consistent supply of uniform materials for use in their refineries,” said Peter Muller, of PerkinElmer. “We expect the spectroscopic monitoring will help us blend different feedstocks to produce an acceptable feedstock in sufficient quantities to support an industry.”

Genera is also providing milled materials, predominantly switchgrass and southern pine generated by the region’s forest products industry, to the other project partners for blending, pelleting and analyses. “The ability to utilize these and other feedstocks in multiple conversion technologies is critical to the success of the biobased industry,” noted Sam Jackson, Genera’s vice president of business development. “Better understanding the milling properties and blending capabilities of feedstocks allows users to mitigate any issues with biomass composition and their impacts on specific processes,” he continued.

Idaho National Laboratory’s role will be to develop models that can predict biomass properties that are important in conversion processes in the production of liquid fuels and biobased chemicals. This involves the demonstration of innovative sensing technologies and the development of feedstock blending and densification technologies that can reduce the cost of biomass.

“Developing economic solutions for integrating woody residue and energy crops can be an incredible low-cost approach to supplying high-quality feedstock for biorefineries and will be key to getting the biobased economy out of the gate,” said Ali Omar, project lead with Herty Advanced Materials Development Center at Georgia Southern University.

With the goal of producing feedstock at a targeted cost of $80 per dry ton or below, the development team is working to find the optimal feedstock available from a combination of southern softwood residuals and purpose-grown energy crops, such as switchgrass and hybrid poplar. Analyzing feedstock quality in terms of quality metrics like ash levels and lignin content will be critical given their promise as low-cost feedstock options.

“What is exciting about this project is that the information developed from this national project will not only have a direct impact on biorefinery developers, but will also help traditional wood products companies improve their operations through the utilization of low-value wood supplies,” said Steve Taylor, project lead at Auburn University.

Rials says the industry has made great strides in the last 10 years, including in feedstock production, but there remain opportunities to further improve the system. “This collaboration will take us one step closer to a valuable new biobased economy,” he said. “The goal continues to be a biobased economy as opposed to a petroleum-based economy, with affordable, renewable fuels and products.”

Are you a landowner looking for an innovative option to simplify leasing your land with a long-term commitment from your tenant?  As a producer, have the recently rocky agriculture markets and fluctuating input prices caused you to think about diversifying your farm income by seeking a steady cashflow for your operation?  At Genera, we have worked with many producers over the years who have had the same concerns. Genera’s crops have provided opportunities for many farms to have a more predictable income stream year after year. We are currently recruiting new landowners and producers as Genera’s sustainable ag fiber manufacturing facility in Vonore, TN is once again expanding due to customer demand for our products!

You have likely seen one of our ads, heard about us via a neighbor, or have been following Genera’s progress over the last couple of years. You may also be asking yourself, “What is an ag fiber manufacturing facility?”.  To help answer that question, let’s start with some background information on ag fibers.  The market demand for domestic, non-wood fiber is already huge and growing rapidly as more and more communities, states, and even entire countries are banning the use of Styrofoam and single use plastics.  Additionally, consumers are looking for more sustainable packaging for food, household, and other products. Agricultural crops provide a sustainable source of fiber for these and many more products. Currently, almost all the ag fiber products available in the U.S. today are imported, primarily from Asia.  To address this market demand and create a simpler, more sustainable supply chain, Genera has developed and constructed a facility here in East Tennessee that takes crops grown by local producers or on local farms, converts that material to a useable pulp fiber, and manufactures that fiber into finished consumer products.  Genera’s initial production facility produces thousands of tons of Earthable® fiber products annually, including bales of market fiber and finished thermoformed food service and packaging products. Genera’s ag-based Earthable® fiber products are cost-competitive and suitable for making paper, toweling, tissue, packaging and disposable foodservice products like plates, bowls, and take-out containers.  All of Genera’s Earthable® fiber products are compostable*/biodegradable, offering locally grown agriculture-based products to a host of markets.  At this time, this facility is the largest integrated manufacturer of ag fiber and products in the United s.

What this Means for the Ag Community

Genera’s technology has proven effective with multiple agricultural crops and residues. Genera has selected the initial fiber crops for its East Tennessee facility based on local agronomic factors, balanced with our customer’s quality and performance requirements. Our core crops, known as feedstocks, will initially include switchgrass and miscanthus.  We have worked with a multitude of other crops and on-going research is being conducted to determine viability of those crops for use in our Vonore facility.  As time goes on, we will continue to seek out new feedstocks that will increase the quality of material we receive as well as increase yield for the producer.

Production of these feedstocks is creating a new market for East Tennessee landowners and agriculture producers.  We are offering competitive rates for ground we are leasing, and our production contracts for switchgrass offer set floor pricing, which will help to project future revenue for your operation.  If you have not already done so, please click the links below to learn more about the crops we are currently processing in the facility.

High biomass sorghum is an annual crop that has been derived from grain sorghum to maximize biomass yields. Plants can grow to 15’ in height, and stalk diameter will be comparable to corn. Yields for biomass sorghum will average around 7 dry tons per acre and the crop can be grown on lower quality ag land.

Planting and management of biomass sorghum can be accomplished using existing equipment (standard planters, sprayers, etc). At harvest, the sorghum will be cut with a mower-conditioner or self-propelled windrower and baled. Biomass sorghum is typically harvested in late July through September. While still containing a high moisture content when mowed, sorghum can be dried in the field to below 20% moisture content prior to baling.

Biomass sorghum may provide some great opportunities to add value to under-utilized pasture acres or low productivity cropland.

Industrial Hemp and/or Kenaf

Long-fiber crops, like industrial hemp or its cousin kenaf, are important sources of non-wood fibers to our industry. These plants produce elongated fibers that are great for creating strength in fiber products like tissue, towel, and paper products. The knowledge-base on these crops has expanded significantly over the last few years, with more and more being produced around the US.

Genera is conducting agricultural production research and product development with these long-fiber crops.

Triticale is a hybrid of wheat and rye commonly used as a cover crop in our region. Triticale offers high yields in a short growing season, often reaching 3-4 dry tons per acre. It makes an excellent winter cover crop after a crop of soybeans or corn.

Genera offers partnership opportunities to Tennessee farmers with launch of sustainable ag-based pulp and fiber facility

East Tennessee company invites growers and landowners in the Tennessee River Valley to join its plant-based manufacturing enterprise   

VONORE, Tenn. – Dec. 17, 2019 – Genera, a Tennessee-based company manufacturing domestically sourced and produced ag-based pulp and molded fiber products, is currently recruiting local and regional agricultural partners to supply the company’s commercial-scale sustainable ag-fiber manufacturing operations.

Genera’s farmer partners will grow crops to supply the company’s Earthable® line of ag fiber based pulp and 100% compostable food service packaging. These products are clear alternatives to plastic and polystyrene food packaging and household products. Genera’s Earthable® manufacturing plant, scheduled to begin production in 2020, will be the largest fully integrated end-to-end facility in the United States for sustainable ag fiber products. The facility will bring harvested switchgrass and biomass sorghum in from the farm and ship finished fiber goods to customers.

“Feedstock supply is an integral part of our business,” said Kelly Tiller, CEO of Genera. “Our local farmer partners are a critical part of the Genera team. The crops they supply are the foundation of what we do – we couldn’t do it without them. Locally grown crops enable us to have a sustainable, local closed loop manufacturing system, truly farm to table!”

In addition to revolutionizing disposable food packaging and household paper products, Genera is expected to have a major positive impact on the local economy. The company will create more than 80 new skilled and non-skilled jobs at the Vonore facility, and its farmer partnerships will offer a new stable market for these crops to the area’s agriculture industry.

“Farming is a tough business,” said Brad Valentine, Genera’s feedstock manager. “It always has been, but there is a great deal of uncertainty right now in the industry. We are providing an opportunity for security for some of the hard-working farmers who are the backbone of Tennessee’s rural economy. Switchgrass and biomass sorghum are strong crops that thrive in a variety conditions, so our partners will be able to count on regular, reliable income every year. In an industry that’s experiencing unpredictable market swings, that can make a real difference.”

Since announcing in July a $118 million investment to launch the Earthable® line, Genera has announced a contract with national industry leader W.G. Yates & Sons Construction Company and multiple management-level hires.

Producer and Landowner Information

Genera’s fiber production process produces a lignin co-product, a light syrup consisting of approximately 40% solids, has significant potential for application in a variety of markets. Made up of lignin, sugars, and inorganics, the coproduct has been utilized for a variety of applications, including:

In animal feeds, similarly used products include lignosulfonates from wood pulp facilities and even molasses. However, unlike lignosulfonate, the co-product does not include any sulfur. In general, Genera’s coproduct can be used as a wet feed additive to increase palatability and some nutrients at a lower cost than many traditional products such as molasses. It can also be used as a pellet binder to help feed pellets better maintain structure, in addition to the added nutritional value.

For dust abatement and deicing applications, our coproduct blend offers better adhesion of products to surfaces and resistance to washing away, noncorrosive freezing point depression, surface tension reduction properties, biodegradability, and viscosity modification among others. Trials on road and aggregate dust abatement and deicing applications have proven very positive.

The coproduct can also be separated into building blocks for other chemicals and products, segregating the inorganics, sugars, and clean lignin. These separated streams are valued for a variety of downstream uses.

 sales@generainc.com for more information and data on our lignin coproduct.

Brad Valentine selected to manage supply chain for the Genera’s Earthable® line of sustainable packaging and fiber products

VONORE, Tenn. – Sept. 10, 2019 – Genera, a Tennessee-based company manufacturing domestically sourced and produced ag-based pulp and molded fiber products, has named Brad Valentine as its feedstock manager. Valentine will be responsible for managing all aspects of agricultural feedstock supply for Genera’s new Tennessee manufacturing facility, working with local farmers to produce biomass crops like switchgrass and biomass sorghum.

Genera recently secured a $118 million investment to produce its Earthable® line of sustainable agricultural fiber products at a new manufacturing facility in Vonore, Tennessee. Earthable® will be the largest fully integrated domestic solution for ag-based fiber and food-grade packaging in the United States.

“Building relationships with area farmers and connecting them to the global market for sustainable foodservice packaging products is a critical innovation that sets Genera apart,” Valentine said. “Genera is on the front lines of finding renewable, economically beneficial solutions for farmers, suppliers, retailers and consumers. It’s rewarding to have a part in that process.”

As feedstock manager, Valentine will manage all aspects of farmer relationships, including acreage recruitment, biomass crop demonstrations, and contracting.  . Valentine’s other feedstock duties will include  research and testing of new crops and production techniques, monitoring agricultural market trends and identifying valuable new technologies. Before joining Genera, Valentine, a graduate of Tennessee Technological University, worked as a research associate for Corteva Agriscience in Proctor, Arkansas.

“Our farm-to-finished product system is a crucial part of what differentiates Genera, so the company’s success depends on our connections with our partner farmers,” said Genera Vice President Sam Jackson. “Brad has demonstrated that he has the experience, passion and skill to manage and expand those connections, which will build Genera and Earthable® into the leading sustainable food packaging solution. Our efforts will also benefit the farmers we work with and rural communities in East Tennessee.”

Genera will begin issuing feedstock production contracts in Fall of 2019 with its fiber production facility scheduled to start delivering Earthable® products to the marketplace in 2020. The company will begin hiring for 80 new skilled and maintenance jobs at the facility in early 2020.

Miscanthus is a perennial grass plant native to tropical, subtropical, and warm temperate parts of Southeast Asia, but has been grown in North America and Europe for decades. The crop is resilient to drought, pest and disease, and is a strong biomass producer, reaching yields of 7-10 dry tons per acre each year.

Miscanthus is different than many crops in that it is established by planting plant parts or root components called rhizomes and not seeds. Like other perennial grasses, it requires low levels of annual fertilization and management, making it an excellent feedstock for fiber products. Miscanthus is managed and harvested similarly to switchgrass in that the fields grow all season long and are harvested in the winter after the plant has gone dormant. This allows the feedstock to dry in the field and for nutrients to go into the root system for winter storage.

Miscanthus has been planted and grow all over the US with great results! Genera is currently leasing land to produce Miscanthus feedstock for fiber products. Please use our interest form to let us know if you have agricultural land suitable for planting!

Genera Secures Investment for Sustainable Packaging and Fiber Products Made From Grass

Tennessee-based company closes financing for its first Earthable® fiber products manufacturing facility

VONORE, Tenn. – July 17, 2019 – Genera announced today it has secured more than $118 million in new investment for its first manufacturing facility to produce its Earthable® line of sustainable agricultural fiber products.

Genera will use locally grown grasses and other agricultural crops to make compostable food service packaging products like plates, bowls, and takeout containers at its new manufacturing facility in Vonore, TN. In addition to making products that are a sustainable alternative to plastics and polystyrene (Styrofoam-type products), Genera’s Earthable® fibers are also used to produce a wide array of towel, tissue, cupstock and other paper products. Earthable® will be the largest fully integrated, domestic solution for ag-based fiber and food-grade packaging in the United States, designed to meet the growing, consumer-driven demands for more eco-friendly products in the food and consumer industries.

“With this new investment, we can begin to answer the increasing demand for environmentally conscious solutions with a truly farm-to-table product made in America,” said Kelly Tiller, president and CEO of Genera. “We’re excited about the new revenue stream we can offer our local farmers. Our Earthable® plant-based paper and packaging products really resonate with consumers. We are passionate about delivering sustainability improvements to the marketplace while making positive impacts in rural economies.”

The financing was anchored by an equity investment from WindSail Capital Group, a growth capital investor specializing in sustainability and energy innovation. WindSail partnered with investors Coppermine Capital and Stairway Capital in the Genera financing.

“We and our partners are investing in Genera because they are pioneering a solution that will serve both our domestic rural economy and the rapidly growing demand for environmentally friendly packaging in the consumer market,” said Ian Bowles, managing director of WindSail Capital Group. “The market opportunity for domestically sourced, non-wood fiber and packaging products is enormous. Genera is uniquely qualified to deliver this solution to the market, given their industry-leading experience managing agricultural biomass supply combined with the team’s experience in biomass processing and manufacturing.”

The fibers are derived from locally grown high-yield, conservation crops like switchgrass and biomass sorghum. Genera has already begun to work with local East Tennessee farmers to produce the feedstock it will use in its new manufacturing facility and is actively seeking additional farm partners in the region.

TennEra LLC, an affiliate of the University of Tennessee Research Foundation (UTRF), has leased its former biorefinery in Vonore, TN, to Genera for the development of the new manufacturing facility.

“We are excited for the positive rural economic benefit of Genera’s fiber production facility in East Tennessee and beyond, furthering UT’s land grant mission,” said Stacey Patterson, president of UTRF and UT vice president for research, outreach and economic development.

Genera’s fiber production facility is expected to be ready to deliver Earthable® products to the marketplace in 2020, initially bringing 80 new jobs to Vonore. The company will begin hiring in early 2020, including skilled operators and maintenance positions. Even before the Vonore facility begins operations, overwhelming customer demand for its products has the company looking at options to increase production capacity at the Vonore facility potentially increasing total employment by 50%.

Genera, a Tennessee-based biomass solutions company, works to simplify supply chains with domestically sourced and produced ag-based pulp and molded fiber products. Partnering with regional farmers, Genera provides a sustainable farm-to-finished product solution for a wide array of applications including compostable food service tableware, to-go containers, packaging, paper, tissue and more.

Switchgrass Establishment Assistance Program

Download a flyer for our Switchgrass Establishment Assistance Program

Started in 2021, Genera’s Switchgrass Establishment Assistance (SEA) program assists our producers with offsetting the cost of establishing new acres of switchgrass.  Through this program, we offer up to a maximum of $200 per acre.  Eligibility for this program, requires a commitment to a five-year Production Agreement and a minimum of 15 acres for new producers.  Each producer interested in taking advantage of the SEA program must work with a Genera representative to develop an Establishment Plan.  Establishment Plans will be tailored to each producer and will vary by type of ground and/or type of equipment available to the producer.  Available assistance is limited.  For more information and so we can begin an application for you, please reach out ASAP!

Once a widely occurring species native to North America, switchgrass’s presence on the landscape as a native prairie grass has declined as development and

modernization creeps further into wild areas.  For years, switchgrass has been a highly sought after native warm season grass for farmers, conservationists, habitat managers, and environmentalists alike.  In more recent years however, awareness of this plant as a high yielding perennial source of biomass has increased, for both use as a forage and a source of fiber, developing markets that would encourage the increased planting of the crop.  Genera has been producing switchgrass in East Tennessee and around the country since 2008.  Early on, we saw the potential for switchgrass to be a great fit with the climate and soil types found in this region, as well as its ability to provide good yields and income to producers in the area.  Switchgrass is the core source of feedstock for our production facility.

Switchgrass is a deep-rooted, non-invasive bunchgrass that can provide many benefits to the producer.  While the crop is slower to establish than most, the appeal of switchgrass for a producer is that it has a high yield potential while requiring minimal inputs.  During establishment, as with any crop and more so with switchgrass, it is vital to suppress any weed competition.  Once established and with the proper management, switchgrass should naturally

outcompete weeds reducing or eliminating the requirements for ongoing weed control applications.  Also, it has been well established that while you cannot completely forego fertilization, nutrient requirements for switchgrass are significantly less than traditional crops while still remaining productive.  Given the deep-rooted structure of the plant, it tends to be more drought tolerant than other crops and can also do well on marginal ground.  Furthermore, successfully established stands of switchgrass have an expected productive lifespan of at least 10-15 years from a single planting!

Switchgrass produces good yields on lower quality soils that are not likely providing an economic return to the farm today. Switchgrass will also provide significant environmental benefits.  Multiple private and public agencies promote the plant as a successful tool when it comes to reducing soil erosion, sedimentation, and for increasing overall soil quality. Stands of switchgrass also provide important cover and nesting habitat for nongame song birds, game birds, deer, and a variety of other wildlife. Since the crop is not harvested until winter, the stand structure remains in place during important breeding and nesting seasons.

Like any farm crop, many factors can affect how productive a stand becomes. In the years that Genera has worked with producers on switchgrass for biomass production, we have realized an average yield of 6 dry tons per acre each year.  Below are two additional links: one for Genera’s Switchgrass Production Guide and another for the Switchgrass Production Budget.  We encourage you to view the information provided in these links to learn more about how switchgrass production might fit into your operation.

If you are ready to talk with our staff to discuss this opportunity further, please fill out the form on the Producer and Landowner Information page or give our Feedstock Manager, Brad Valentine a call at 423-884-4119.

Genera announces top engineering hires as launch of sustainable ag-based pulp and molded fiber products nears

Plant engineer Timothy Watkins and production engineer Tyler Winston join innovative biomass solutions company

VONORE, Tenn. – Feb. 3, 2020 – Genera, a manufacturer of domestically sourced and produced ag-based pulp and molded fiber products, has named Timothy Watkins and Tyler Winston to two top engineering positions at the company’s East Tennessee facility.

The announcement marks continued progress toward full production of Genera’s innovative Earthable® line of sustainable, ag-based fiber products later in 2020.

“Timothy and Tyler will work together closely to manage the technical knowledge and processes of the facility, so this is an important step forward for us,” said Genera COO Keith Brazzell. “We’re counting on them to provide leadership throughout startup and then engineer reliable and efficient operations. Fortunately, they’ve jumped in and already proven that they’re great additions to our team. They share our vision for the enormous possibilities here.”

As plant engineer, Watkins will lead all engineering activities for the facility, including managing capital project and operation activities and process engineering. Winston’s duties as production engineer include leading all engineering activities for thermoforming, packaging and associated areas. He also will manage capital projects, operations activities and process engineering.

Both Watkins and Winston will also be responsible for maintaining plant material and energy balances and process control, performing capital and maintenance planning, and long-term production scheduling, among other tasks.

“This is a chance to be part of something unique,” Watkins said. “There’s going to be a lot of hard work, but Genera’s also going to make a meaningful impact by introducing accessible sustainable packaging and also supporting local farmers. Tyler and I are excited to be part of it.”

Watkins, a graduate of the University of Mississippi with a bachelor of science degree in chemical engineering, most recently served as plant manager of Twin Rivers Paper Company in Pickens, Mississippi, a job he had held since 2017. During a 26-year career, Watkins has also held engineering and management positions in Indiana, Tennessee and Louisiana.

Winston recently served as production engineer for Unipres North America in White House, Tennessee, where he managed installation and start-up of over two-hundred automotive robotic assemblies. He has held manufacturing engineering positions in Michigan, Louisiana and Texas, including at Georgia-Pacific, LLC’s Port Hudson tissue-towel paper-converting operations. Winston received a bachelor of science degree in mechanical engineering from Texas Tech University.

“Genera’s already committed to a culture of innovation, cooperation and community engagement,” Winston said. “Timothy and I are looking forward to implementing that culture in our operations and production.”

In addition to the largest fully integrated domestic solution for ag-based fiber and food-grade packaging, Genera also supports the local economy through its partnerships with farmers in the area, who produce switchgrass and biomass sorghum for Earthable® production. Genera’s fiber production facility is expected to bring up to 120 new jobs to East Tennessee.

Genera Quality Assurance Manager Ricky Rutherford

VONORE, Tenn., Aug. 5, 2021 / Genera, a manufacturer of domestically sourced and produced ag-based pulp and molded fiber products, has named Alan Turner controller and Richard Rutherford quality assurance manager.

Turner will oversee all aspects of accounting operations and financial reporting. He will also work closely with Genera’s chief financial officer to plan and manage operating and capital budgets. Rutherford will ensure the quality of Genera’s products through testing, data analysis and training.

“We are excited to add Alan and Richard to our management team,” said Genera COO Keith Brazzell. “As we build on our successful launch, the skills and expertise they bring will be crucial to sustaining that success. Both of them are at the top of their professions, and we can’t wait to see how they will help shape Genera’s future.”

Genera’s Earthable® line of sustainable, ag-based fiber products is designed to meet growing demand for cost-effective and eco-friendly consumer packaging alternatives to single-use plastics and polystyrene.

Turner, who earned his M.B.A. at the University of Tennessee, has extensive experience in the manufacturing sector. He has worked as a plant controller and accounting manager for manufacturers in various industries. He has helped companies improve accounting processes by identifying inefficiencies and reducing costs throughout his career.

Rutherford is a chemist with a master’s degree from Middle Tennessee State University and an M.B.A. from the University of Phoenix. He has worked as a chemist and managed laboratories throughout East Tennessee. He and his teams have earned multiple awards for quality assurance.

“I’ve been fortunate to have a great deal of experience with manufacturing across a range of industries,” Turner said. “What excites me the most about joining Genera is their innovation. The Earthable® line is a groundbreaking product that is creating jobs and supporting farmers in our region. I’m privileged to be a part of it.”

Rutherford agreed. “The opportunity to help make these amazing products the best they can be is a dream job. I’m excited to work with this dynamic, multi-disciplinary team on Earthable® products as well as future innovations.”

Genera’s fully operational facility processes agricultural crops such as switchgrass into ag-based fiber and the Earthable® line of sustainable food-grade, compostable packaging. The facility, which is the largest fully integrated domestic solution for ag-based fiber and food packaging in North America, will host 160 employees at full production.
