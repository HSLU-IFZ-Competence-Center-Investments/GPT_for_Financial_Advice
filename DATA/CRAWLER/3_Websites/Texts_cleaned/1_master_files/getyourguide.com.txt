[[]][[] ] [][[][Become a supplier]][][[[] ][]][][[[] ][Wishlist]][][[[] ][Cart]][] [[[] ][Profile ]][] [Skip to content] [ [[[[Legal Notice |  | General Terms and Conditions | Security][

Privacy Policy

The protection of your personal data is important to us. With this privacy policy, we would like to explain to you in more detail what personal data we collect and for what purposes this data is processed. United States residents should consult the section titled “United States residents’ rights” for rights that apply to them. Please also see our supplementary CCPA here.

The controller for purposes of processing your personal data is:

GetYourGuide Deutschland GmbHSonnenburger Strasse 7310437 BerlinGermany

If you have any questions or suggestions regarding data protection or would like to exercise your rights, please feel free to contact us at the following link:  https://www.getyourguide.com/contact/

You can reach our Data Protection Officer at:][ ][

For clarity, any data processing by activity providers who offer their services on the GetYourGuide platform is subject to their respective privacy policies. Activity providers act as separate data controllers.

2. Subject of data protection

The subject of data protection is personal data, i.e. all information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person. Personal data is also referred to simply as data in the following.

3. Automated data collection

When accessing our website, your end device automatically transmits data for technical reasons. The following data is stored separately from other data that you may transmit to us: 

URL of the page accessed

Latency of the network connection

We store this data for the following purposes:

for load balancing, i.e. to distribute access to our website across several devices and to be able to offer you the fastest possible loading times;

to ensure the security of our IT systems, e.g. to defend against specific attacks on our systems and to recognise attack patterns;

to ensure the proper operation of our IT systems, e.g. if errors occur that we can only rectify by storing the IP address;

to enable criminal prosecution, averting of danger or legal prosecution in the event of specific indications of criminal offences.

Your IP address is only stored for a period of 30 days.

In this case, the processing is carried out to ensure the security of the processing in accordance with Art. 32 GDPR, as well as on the basis of our legitimate interest in protecting ourselves against misuse of our service (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR).

Alternatively, you can log in with your Facebook, Google or Apple account. In this case, we receive the following personal data from Facebook or Google or Apple in order to create a user account for you:

Your registration data is required to set up and manage a user account for you. In this case, you conclude a (free) user agreement with us, on the basis of which we collect this data (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b GDPR).

In order to conclude the agreement, you must provide us with this data. However, you are neither contractually nor legally obliged to conclude the agreement and thus to provide the data.

After you have created a customer account, you have the option to create wish lists with activities and tours and to share these wish lists with other users. Your data is processed for these purposes in order to be able to provide you with the corresponding functions (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b GDPR).

5. Reviews and ratings

Our website offers the possibility to rate and comment on tours or activities. After you have completed a tour booked via our website, we may ask you to rate it accordingly. Submitting a rating is, of course, voluntary. When you submit a rating, we collect the data you enter in order to process it according to the function you use and publish it on our website. You can have a rating deleted at any time by contacting our customer service.

You can object at any time to receiving review requests by clicking the unsubscribe link in each review request email. If you have an account, you can also do so from the Settings -> Notifications section on your profile. Otherwise, you can also send us a message using the link https://www.getyourguide.com/contact/.

The processing of your data for these purposes is done to protect our legitimate interest in providing our users with as much information as possible about the tours we offer. User ratings are also in the interest of all users. Accordingly, the processing is based on Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR.

6.1. Processing of enquiries

Your request will be processed by our processor, GetYourGuide Global Services GmbH.

For the processing of enquiries, we or GetYourGuide Global Services GmbH use systems provided by Freshworks Inc. based in the USA ("Freshworks"). Accordingly, your enquiries are stored on Freshworks's servers. There is no EU Commission adequacy decision for the USA. We have therefore concluded the standard contractual clauses approved by the EU Commission with Freshworks in accordance with Art. 46 para. 2 lit. c GDPR. In addition, the data is stored in Frankfurt, Germany.

For the processing of telephone enquiries, we or GetYourGuide Global Services GmbH use systems provided by Talkdesk Inc. based in the USA ("Talkdesk"). There is no EU Commission adequacy decision for the USA. We have therefore concluded the standard contractual clauses approved by the EU Commission with Talkdesk in accordance with Art. 46 para. 2 lit. c GDPR. In addition, the data is stored in Ireland.

For the processing and administration of enquiries via our social media channels, we or GetYourGuide Global Services GmbH also use the services of NICE Ltd, based in the UK. Therefore, we have concluded the  standard contractual clauses approved by the EU Commission with NICE in accordance with Art. 46 para. 2 lit. c GDPR.

6.2. Improvement of customer service

In order to continuously improve our customer service, we analyse enquiries sent to us on the basis of certain parameters and keywords. Although, as a matter of principle, no analysis is carried out on the basis of personal data, it cannot be ruled out that, in individual cases, personal data may also be processed within this context. The processing required within this context serves our legitimate interest as well as that of our customers in the continuous improvement of our customer service (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR). 

For the evaluation of enquiries, we use the systems of the providers Chattermill Analytics Limited (Great Britain), Miuros S.A.S. (France) and Looker Data Sciences, Inc. (USA). There is no EU Commission adequacy decision for the USA. We have therefore concluded the standard contractual clauses approved by the EU Commission with Looker Data Sciences, Inc. pursuant to Art. 46 para. 2 lit. c GDPR. 

In certain cases, it is necessary for us to translate incoming requests into a specific language. This may require the processing of personal data necessary to protect our legitimate interest in providing international customer service, Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR. For this purpose, we use the service of Unbabel Inc. based in the USA ("Unbabel"). There is no EU Commission adequacy decision for the USA. We have therefore concluded the standard contractual clauses approved by the EU Commission with Unbabel in accordance with Art. 46 para. 2 lit. c GDPR.

6.4. Storage and evaluation of telephone calls

Telephone calls are only stored and analysed if you have given us your prior consent. We will only use this data for the purpose of improving our customer service. The recordings will be deleted after three months. The legal basis is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR. You have the option to revoke your consent at any time by contacting one of the contact channels mentioned in this privacy policy. This will not affect the lawfulness of the processing carried out by us until your revocation.

7. Technical service providers

We use technical service providers for hosting and some of the services required for the website. Accordingly, the processing of data takes place on the servers of these service providers. These service providers only process the data according to our explicit instructions and are obliged to guarantee sufficient technical and organisational measures for data protection. Consequently, our service providers act for us as so-called processors within the meaning of Art. 28 GDPR.

7.1. Hosting of the website

For the hosting of our website, we use the services of Amazon Web Services EMEA S.a.r.l. ("AWS") based in Luxembourg. Accordingly, when you interact with our website or provide personal data, it is processed on AWS servers. We only use servers located in the European Union. To cover remote maintenance and similar constellations, we have concluded the  standard contractual clauses approved by the EU Commission with AWS in accordance with Art. 46 para. 2 lit. c GDPR.7.2. E-mail system

For sending emails, we use the Sendgrid service of Twilio Inc based in the USA ("Twilio"). There is no adequacy decision for the USA. We have therefore concluded the standard contractual clauses approved by the EU Commission pursuant to Art. 46 para. 2 lit. c GDPR with Twilio.

You have the option on our website to register for our newsletter. With our newsletter, we would like to send you information on offers, tours, activities or special promotions that is as personalised as possible. By registering for our newsletter, you therefore consent to us processing your email address for the purpose of sending the newsletter. The legal basis for this processing is Art. 6 para. 1 lit a GDPR. You can revoke your consent at any time by unsubscribing from our newsletter. To do this, you can use the unsubscribe link contained in every email or send us a message using the link https://www.getyourguide.com/contact/. To verify your e-mail address, you will first receive a registration e-mail, which you must confirm via a link (double opt-in). When you register for the newsletter, we store the IP address and the date and time of registration. The processing of this data is necessary in order to be able to prove that consent has been given. The legal basis results from our legal obligation to prove your consent (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. c in conjunction with Art. 7 para. 1 GDPR).

If you have booked a tour via our website or created a GetYourGuide account, we will send you our newsletter based on our legitimate interest in promoting similar services to your bookings or account (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR, § 7 para. 3 UWG) unless you have objected to this use. If cookies are used for personalisation, we will obtain your separate consent.

You can object to this at any time – even during registration – by deselecting the corresponding checkbox or clicking the unsubscribe link in the respective emails. In addition, if you have an account, you can always subscribe or unsubscribe to different types of communication from the Settings -> Notifications section on your profile. 

For the dispatch of our newsletter and the personalisation of content, we use the services of the provider Braze Inc. based in the USA ("Braze"). There is no EU Commission adequacy decision for the USA. We have therefore concluded the standard contractual clauses approved by the EU Commission with Braze in accordance with Art. 46 para. 2 lit. c GDPR.

9. Bookings & payments

When you book a tour, activity or similar on our site, we collect the data required to carry out the tour. This usually includes the following information: First and last name, billing address, email address, telephone number, number of participants, date and time. Depending on the activity booked, it may also be necessary for us to collect further information, such as your flight number or the age of the participants. The processing that takes place in connection with this is based on Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b GDPR. To the extent necessary, we will transfer your data to the provider responsible for the tour or activity who will process your personal data as set out in their privacy policy as an independent data controller. If a transfer to a third country outside the European Economic Area is necessary, this is based on Art. 49 para. 2 lit. b, c GDPR. 

If you make bookings via partner sites, you will be redirected to provide you personal data and conclude the booking process on the GetYourGuide website, as described above. On some partner sites, your data is collected by the partner as a separate data controller, in accordance with their privacy policy, and we receive the data required to make the booking from the partner. 

On other websites who have partnered with us in order to integrate the booking offers directly on their own website, both the partner and GetYourGuide act as separate data controllers for the processing of your personal data. 

In order to keep you updated on your bookings we will send you booking confirmations as well as reminders and updates for upcoming bookings (e.g. changed times or meeting points) to make sure that you have all information you need to attend your booked services. Booking confirmations are sent to your email address, and/or by SMS to the phone number you provide during the booking process and/or through a push notification from GYG app. If you have an account, you can choose more granularly how you want to be notified from the Settings -> Notifications section on your profile.

We process your personal data in order to be able to provide you with these features of our service (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b GDPR).

You have various options for paying for your booking. In doing so, we will process the data required in each case depending on the selected payment method. Within this context, your personal data will be processed as described below, which is based on Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b GDPR and is necessary to carry out the payment method you have chosen.

9.3.1. Credit card payments

For the processing of payments by credit card, we use the service provider Adyen N.V. ("Adyen"), which is based in the Netherlands. The data provided during your payment will be forwarded by Adyen to the respective banks or financial institutions for the purpose of processing the payment. In the case of payments by credit card, we only receive the information that a payment has or has not been made, along with the last 4 digits of the credit card number. We therefore have no knowledge of your full credit card number.

9.3.2. Payment via PayPal

If you have a PayPal account, you can also process your payment via PayPal. In this case, we receive from PayPal not only the information that a payment has been made, but also the e-mail address and address you have registered with PayPal.

9.3.3. Payment by invoice

If you pay by invoice, we will transfer your personal data to Klarna Bank AB (publ) based in Sweden ("Klarna"). Klarna will process the data first for the purpose of credit assessment and then, if necessary, for payment processing.

In the event of chargebacks, we will transfer the necessary data to Global Merchant Risk Technologies trading as The Chargeback Company (Chargebacks911) based in Ireland to process a chargeback. The required data includes your name, booking information, telephone number and payment information. Chargebacks911 will then process the chargeback with your bank or PayPal or Ayden. The processing is carried out within the context of the execution of the contract (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b GDPR) as well as on the basis of our legitimate interest in the effective processing of chargebacks (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR).

9.5. Booking Cancellation Insurance

If you visit our website from certain regions, you will be able to also book activities with extended cancellation rights covered by insurance. The insurance coverage is offered to you by Companjon Admin GmbH with registered address at c/o Wilhelm Rechtsanwälte Partnerschaft von Rechtsanwälten mbB, Reichsstraße 43, 40217 Düsseldorf. If you book this option, your personal data will be processed based on Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b GDPR. 

With regards to the data processing connected to offering these insurances on the GetYourGuide website, GetYourGuide and Companjon Admin GmbH act as joint data controllers. With regards to the data processing directly connected to the insurance contract (such as eligibility, decision making process, claim processing etc.), Companjon Admin GmbH acts as an independent data controller. 

You can excercise your data subject rights towards either GetYourGuide or Companjon and we will ensure the requests is forwarded to the responsible party. 

In order to protect ourselves and the activity providers from fraudulent bookings, we evaluate the information provided by our customers during the booking process, including the data technically transmitted by their device, insofar as this is necessary to protect our legitimate interest and that of the activity providers in reliable bookings (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR). 

For this purpose, we use services of the providers Sift Science, Inc. (USA), Adyen N.V. (Netherlands) and Ethoca Inc. (Canada). There is no EU Commission adequacy decision for the USA. We have therefore concluded the standard contractual clauses approved by the EU Commission with Sift Science, Inc. pursuant to Art. 46 para. 2 lit. c GDPR. For Canada, there is an adequacy decision by the EU Commission in accordance with Art. 45 GDPR for processing by private-sector organisations.

11. Protection against bots

To protect us from bots and similar technologies, we use the Cheq service provided by CHEQ AI Technologies Ltd. based in Israel ("Cheq"). Cheq will use the data automatically transmitted by your device to determine whether the request most likely originates from a human. No further storage of the data will take place. The processing is carried out in order to ensure the security of the processing in accordance with Art. 32 GDPR and on the basis of our legitimate interest in protecting ourselves against misuse of our service (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR). For Israel, there is an adequacy decision of the EU Commission according to Art. 45 GDPR.

We use so-called "cookies" to offer certain functions of our website and to optimise the use of our website. "Cookies" are small files that are stored on your device with the help of your internet browser. 

Specifically, we use (unless other cookies are specified elsewhere in this privacy policy or our cookie consent) the following cookies:

Session cookies: These cookies are needed to store certain technical data during your visit to our website, e.g. to determine whether you have logged in.

Persistent cookies: These cookies are needed to store data beyond a browser session if you wish to do so.

The legal basis for the use of these cookies is § 15 para. 1 of the German Telemedia Act (TMG) or Art. 6 para. 1 b GDPR, insofar as they are necessary for the use of our website and the functions you have accessed. Otherwise, we use cookies – as described below – on the basis of your consent. You can revoke your consent at any time via our consent manager.

13.1. Customer surveys and research panels

We or research agencies we collaborate with might invite you to participate in moderated or unmoderated research panels. You might be either a GetYourGuide Customer or an external participant recruited independently by the agency. The participation and the video recordings of these sessions are always based on your express consent, which we collect in writing before the research activity. Research agencies we might collaborate with are: Respondent, Inc., a company based in the US (you can find their Privacy Policy here), Userlytics, a compay based in the US (you can find their Privacy Policy here), Lookback Group Inc., a company located in the US (you can find their Privacy Policy here). These research agencies act as data controllers. We invite you to participate based on our legitimate interest and we do not address you in case you have opted out of marketing emails. 

When you access our website, you might be prompted in a pop-up window to answer some questions about the GetYourGuide product or features. We collect the answers in an aggregate form and they are not linked personally to you. This is completely optional and you give your consent for us to process your answers if you choose to answer the questions. 

14. Marketing and remarketing services

14.1. Evaluation of advertising on the web and on social media platforms

With regard to our social media advertising, we use a service provided by Smartly.io Solutions Oy, based in Finland, to analyse the success of our advertisements.  

We use the services of Google LLC, 1600 Amphitheatre Pkwy Mountain View, California 94043, USA ("Google") described below. There is no EU Commission adequacy decision for the USA. We have therefore concluded the standard contractual clauses approved by the EU Commission with Google in accordance with Art. 46 para. 2 lit. c GDPR.

Basic information on the processing of your personal data by Google can be found here: https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en. 

You also have the following setting options with Google: 

You can deactivate personalised advertising from Google: https://adssettings.google.com/anonymous?hl=en&sig=ACi0TCie_PP0WXzD2NDiHGJny9ca0PSQVyMysggnxws0C7Hxy7edd8F9O3gyme7JNE3bplGpLmt8pU3iFPJYnpIHlEL7FSn5hXWg8EhEQAbCywX-v9nEW3M

You can disable personalised advertising on a device-by-device basis: (https://support.google.com/ads/answer/1660762?hl=en-GB#mob)

You can disable personalised advertising by browser: (http://optout.networkadvertising.org/?c=1)

14.2.1 Google Analytics 360

If you have consented, we use Google Analytics 360, a web analytics service. Google Analytics 360 collects pseudonymous data from you about the use of our website, including your shortened IP address, and uses cookies. This data is transmitted to a Google server in the USA and stored there. Google will use this information for the purpose of evaluating your use of the website, compiling reports on website activity, and providing other services relating to website activity and internet usage. Google may also transfer this information to third parties where required to do so by law, or where such third parties process the information on Google's behalf. 

Your data will be stored by Google Analytics for a period of 14 months. After this period, the data is deleted and only aggregated statistics are kept.

The use of Google Analytics is based on your consent (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR).

You can revoke your consent at any time and deactivate Google Analytics using a browser add-on. You can download this here: http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout. Alternatively, you can revoke your consent as described here: https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/analyticsjs/user-opt-out. You can also revoke your consent via our consent manager. This does not affect the lawfulness of the processing carried out until your revocation.

14.2.2. Google Remarketing & Advertising Personalisation on the Google Network

If you have consented, we use remarketing services from Google. Google uses cookies to record your usage behaviour on our website in order to display interest-based advertising for our products on other pages within the Google advertising network across devices. This includes Google search and other sites operated by Google and its subsidiaries, as well as sites operated by Google's advertising partners. The information is transmitted accordingly to Google and Google's partners. Additional data processing will only take place if you have consented to Google linking your browsing history to your Google Account and using information from your Google Account to personalise the ads you see on the web. In this case, Google will use your data together with Google Analytics data to create and define target group lists for remarketing. To do this, your personal data will be temporarily linked by Google with Google Analytics data to form target groups.

The use of these services is based on your consent (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR).

You can revoke your consent via our consent manager. This does not affect the lawfulness of the processing carried out until your revocation. Furthermore, the remarketing cookie is automatically deleted as soon as it is no longer necessary for the purposes for which we collected or used it in accordance with the above paragraphs.

If you have consented, we use the YouTube pixel. This is a tracking code that is loaded when our website and certain subpages are accessed and when certain actions are performed, and thus tracks your behaviour on our website. The pixel also collects usage data (such as URL, referrer URL, IP address, device and browser properties and timestamp). We send this information to Google so that Google can display advertisements on YouTube according to your behaviour on our website.

We use the YouTube pixel on the basis of your consent (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR). You can revoke your consent at any time via our consent manager. This does not affect the lawfulness of the processing carried out until your revocation. 

14.2.4. Google Enhanced Conversions

This technology is based neither on cookies nor on pixels. When you use our website and are redirected by a Google ad, we send a hashed identifier and information about possible purchases to Google. Google will use this information only to understand which ad you clicked, to measure the success of certain ads and to provide us with this information in aggregate form. In particular, Google will not use the data to serve targeted ads to you or to other users, or store or use the data for any other purpose. We transmit this data on the basis of our legitimate interest in controlling our marketing activities (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR).

14.2.5. Retargeting and audience matching

If you give us your consent, we use services provided by Google Ireland Limited to show you personalized ads on Google and to reach audiences which are similar to you. In this case, we transfer your encrypted (hashed) email address along with information about website behaviour to Google. Google will then match your encrypted data with their database and, if you have a Google account with personalized ads enabled, identify you to show you ads for GetYourGuide. The processing is carried out based on your consent (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR). You can withdraw your consent at any time with future effect by rejecting Marketing Technologies in our consent manager. Google may process your personal data in the USA. There is no EU Commission adequacy decision for the USA. We have therefore concluded the standard contractual clauses approved by the EU Commission with Google in accordance with Art. 46 para. 2 lit. c GDPR.

We use the services of Facebook Ireland Limited ("Facebook") described below. Please note that this may also involve processing by Facebook Inc. based in the USA. There is no EU Commission adequacy decision for the USA. In this case, Facebook will use the standard contractual clauses approved by the EU Commission, which constitute a suitable guarantee within the meaning of Art. 46 para. 2 lit. c GDPR for the transfer to third countries.

Basic information on the further processing and use of your data by Facebook as well as your setting options for protecting your privacy with Facebook can be found in Facebook's privacy policy at  https://www.facebook.com/privacy/explanation.

If you have consented, the Facebook pixel is used on our website. This is a Javascript code. The Facebook pixel records when you perform certain actions on our website or visit certain areas on our website. The Facebook pixel also collects usage data (such as URL, referrer URL, IP address, device and browser characteristics and timestamp). The Facebook pixel generates a checksum (hash value) from this information and transmits this hash value to Facebook. If available, the Facebook cookie is also addressed and your Facebook ID is transmitted. If you have a Facebook profile and log in there, you can be presented with targeted personalised advertising on Facebook based on the data transmitted by the pixel. Data from users who do not have a Facebook profile is discarded by Facebook without being used. 

We use the Facebook pixel on the basis of your consent (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR). You can revoke your consent at any time via our consent manager. This does not affect the lawfulness of the processing carried out until your revocation. 

This technology is based neither on cookies nor on pixels. When you use our website and are redirected by Facebook, we send your Facebook Click-ID and information about possible purchases and other actions on our website to Facebook. Facebook will use this information to understand which ad you clicked, to measure the success of certain ads and to provide us with this information in aggregate form. Facebook will not use the data to serve targeted ads to you or other users. We transmit this data on the basis of our legitimate interest in controlling our marketing activities (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR).

14.3.3. Retargeting and audience matching

If you give us your consent, we use services provided by Meta Platforms, Inc. (USA) to show you personalized ads on Facebook and to reach audiences which are similar to you. In this case, we transfer your encrypted (hashed) email address along with information about website behaviour to Facebook.

We also process your data in order to display personalised content on our website. The legal basis for this is our legitimate interest in showing you tours and activities that are relevant to you, Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR. 

19. Further sharing of data

Beyond the cases described, your personal data will only be passed on without your express prior consent in the following cases: 

If it is necessary for the clarification of an illegal use of our services or for legal prosecution, personal data will be forwarded to the law enforcement authorities and, if necessary, to injured third parties. However, this only happens if there are specific indications of unlawful or abusive behaviour. A transfer may also take place if this serves to enforce terms of use or other agreements. We are also legally obliged to provide information to certain public authorities upon request. These are law enforcement agencies, authorities that prosecute administrative offences subject to fines and the tax authorities. 

This data is disclosed on the basis of our legitimate interest in combating abuse, prosecuting criminal offences and securing, asserting and enforcing claims and provided that your rights and interests in the protection of your personal data are not overridden, Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR or on the basis of a legal obligation pursuant to Art. 6 para. 1 lit. c GDPR.

We disclose personal data to auditors, accounting service providers, lawyers, banks, tax consultants and similar bodies insofar as this is necessary for the provision of our services (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b GDPR) or the proper operation of our business (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR) or we are obliged to do so (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. c GDPR). 

We rely on contractually affiliated third-party companies and external service providers ("processors") to provide the services. In such cases, personal data is passed on to these processors to enable them to continue processing. These processors are carefully selected and regularly reviewed by us to ensure that your rights and freedoms are protected. The processors may only use the data for the purposes specified by us and are also contractually obliged by us to treat your data exclusively in accordance with this privacy policy and the German data protection laws.

The transfer of data to processors takes place on the basis of Art. 28 para. 1 GDPR.

As part of the further development of our business, it may happen that the structure of GetYourGuide Deutschland GmbH changes by changing the legal form, founding, buying or selling subsidiaries, parts of the company or components. In such transactions, customer information is passed on together with the part of the company to be transferred. Whenever personal information is disclosed to third parties to the extent described above, we will ensure that this is done in accordance with this privacy policy and the relevant data protection laws.

Any disclosure of personal data is justified by the fact that we have a legitimate interest in adapting our corporate form to the economic and legal circumstances as necessary (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR).

20. Automated individual decisions or profiling measures

We do not use any automated processing processes to bring about a decision or profiling.

21. Erasure of your data

We delete or anonymise your personal data as soon as it is no longer necessary for the purposes for which we collected or used it in accordance with the above paragraphs. We also continue to retain your data if we are obliged to do so for legal reasons or if the data is needed for a longer period of time for criminal prosecution or to secure, assert or enforce legal claims. 

If you delete your user account, your profile will be deleted completely and permanently. However, we will retain backup copies of your data to the extent and for as long as this data is required for legal reasons or for criminal prosecution or to secure, assert or enforce legal claims.

If data must be retained for legal reasons, processing will be restricted. The data is then no longer available for further use.

Storage beyond the contractual relationship is based on our aforementioned legitimate interests according to Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR.

22. Your rights as a data subject

You have the rights described below with regard to the processing of your personal data. To exercise your rights, you can make a request here, by post or by email to the address above.

This right exists in particular if the accuracy of the personal data is disputed between the user and us, for the duration that the verification of the accuracy requires, as well as in the event that the data subject requests restricted processing instead of erasure in the case of an existing right to erasure; furthermore, in the event that the data is no longer required for the purposes pursued by us, but the user requires it for the assertion, exercise or defence of legal claims, as well as if the successful exercise of an objection is still disputed between us and the user. 

22.5. Right to data portability

You have the right to receive from us the personal data relating to you that you have provided to us in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format in accordance with Art. 20 GDPR.

We will then stop processing your personal data unless we can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing that override your interests, rights and freedoms, or the processing serves to assert, exercise or defend legal claims.

22.7. Right of appeal

You have the right to contact a supervisory authority of your choice in case of complaints. 

22.8. Data processing when exercising your rights

Finally, we would like to point out that we process the personal data provided by you when exercising your rights pursuant to Art. 15 to 22 GDPR for the purpose of implementing these rights and to be able to provide evidence thereof.

All Countries (Except the US): If you reside anywhere in the world except for the United State of America, applies to you. 

United States of America: If you reside in the United States of America (including its territories and possessions), applies to you.

1. About usWe, GetYourGuide Deutschland GmbH, registered address Sonnenburger Straße 71-75, 10437 Berlin, Germany, registered with the Charlottenburg Local Court under HRB 132059 B, ("GetYourGuide" or "we" or "us") is the operator of the GYG Platform and are responsible for it accordingly. Our platform is available worldwide in multiple languages and is quick and easy to use.We operate the GYG Platform as an intermediary platform on which tours and Activities ("Activity”) are offered online by a variety of local activity providers such as amusement parks, museums, tour guides, boat tours around the world ("Suppliers"). The Activities include, for example, guided tours, cooking classes, sightseeing tours by bus, boat trips, tickets for sightseeing, and other services. We act as a commercial agent for the Suppliers. The descriptions, photographs, and other content for its own Activities originate from the respective Suppliers. We therefore have no direct influence on such content.

As soon as you use the GYG Platform, you are obliged to comply with these GYG GTC. Therefore, please read them carefully during your first use.2.2 They are available online and apply to all of our services, unless more specific terms and conditions for a specific service prevail. Should this be the case, we will make this clear at the appropriate time. Any of your terms and conditions that conflict with or deviate from the GYG GTC shall not apply unless we have expressly agreed to them in writing.2.3 The use of the GYG Platform is only for you personally, i.e. you may not use it under any circumstances for business purposes. Keyword: Reselling tickets is absolutely forbidden ! This means that any use that goes beyond your personal use in your private environment and/or serves commercial or business purposes, those personally connected to you and/or other third parties, in particular the commercial resale of tickets, is strictly prohibited.

3. What we do3.1 You can view Activities on the GYG Platform. The contract for the provision of the Activity is concluded exclusively and directly between you and the Supplier ("Service Agreement"). When you buy an Activity on the GYG Platform, you  are not buying anything from us, but directly from the Supplier. Service Agreements are concluded by us on behalf and for the account of the Suppliers. We act as a commercial agent for the Suppliers and are commissioned and authorized by the Suppliers to conclude transactions directly between Suppliers and Users, e.g. you, and for the account of the Suppliers and to collect payments from the Users. We do not offer any activities ourselves and therefore do not become your contractual party to any Service Agreement. We do not act as the organizer, the landlord, reseller or other contractual partner in relation to the Service Agreement with you. We receive a commission from the Supplier for brokering the Service Agreement. 

3.2 You can filter the list of Activities by different parameters. The discovery wizard will show you Activities that match your criteria and are offered by a specific Supplier. If more than one Supplier is able to offer an Activity that matches the criteria entered in the discovery wizard, the applicable Activities will be displayed in an order based on the factors including popularity, diversity, availability, cancellation rate, rating, performance over time, and amount of revenue generated.3.3 In the interest of a fast and smooth process, you may direct questions about your booking to the GetYourGuide customer service. For this purpose you can find various forms on Contact us ⎸GetYourGuide, as well as through our hotline. As commercial agents, we support the Suppliers in this process. We usually answer within 24 hours, or at the latest usually within 48 hours. The communication between you and the Supplier can be done directly. In case of emergency, the contact details of the respective Supplier can be found on your voucher/ticket.3.4 We reserve the right to make the use of the GYG Platform, individual functions of the GYG Platform or the extent to which individual functions can be used, subject to certain conditions, such as the payment behavior of the User (e.g. in the case of prior bookings) or the presentation of certain proof (e.g. proof of identity, purchase, payment, or ownership). We reserve the right to restrict your booking of Activities, or cancel Activities you have booked, in the case of suspected fraud, violation of these GYG GTC, or violation of obligations under the Service Agreement, which become known to GetYourGuide.3.5 We are not obligated to improve, extend (update/upgrade) or make available the content, functions and services provided via the GYG Platform. We may discontinue our services and performances at any time; there is no right to continuation. However, if you have already concluded a Service Agreement with a Supplier, Section 15 applies to you, i.e. the Service Agreement.

A blocking, termination or deletion of your GYG Account is possible at any time via the GetYourGuide customer service by phone or via the contact form under "Delete account". The contact details can be found at Contact us ⎸GetYourGuide .6.3 GetYourGuide may unilaterally terminate your User Agreement, GYG Account or your access to the GYG Platform at any time with a notice period of one week. However, the termination will become effective only after any already established Service Agreements have been executed or canceled. The right to termination for good cause remains unaffected.

7. Customer Service / Best Price Matching by GetYourGuide7.1 You can reach our customer services team at Contact us ⎸GetYourGuide , we are available by phone, chat or email.7.2 If you find the activity booked via the GYG Platform (i) with the same conditions (date, city, number of persons), (ii) with the same services, (iii) at a lower price on the Internet, (iv) bookable with the same Supplier and prove this to us, we will pay you the difference between the lower price booked via GetYourGuide and the lower price found and available by you on the Internet. Offers that are part of trust or loyalty programs are excluded from best price matching.7.3 To make use of this best price matching offer, you must send us the link (and/or a screenshot of the alternative offer) upon request. We will then check this and should the price actually be lower, pay the difference, whereby this payment can also be made by means of a voucher.7.4 All special offers and discount promotions are marked as such.

8. Payment at GetYourGuide8.1 The price offered on the GYG Platform ("Posted Price") shall apply to the Activity. The amount you pay for an Activity ("Booking Price") is the Posted Price less any applicable discount. Unless otherwise agreed, the Booking Price for the Activity is payable immediately upon booking. 

8.2 For selected Activities, you may be able to choose the "Reserve now, pay later" feature. This is only possible with a credit card that is valid at least until the date of the selected Activity; to confirm this, we will charge 0 EUR to your credit card when you complete your booking. 72 hours before the start of the Activity we will debit the Booking Price. If the credit card charge fails, you have 47 hours to make the payment manually. If this fails and the payment is not made, we will automatically cancel the Activity you booked.

8.3 GetYourGuide is entitled to receive the invoiced amounts in the name of and on behalf of the Supplier (as a commercial agent), unless otherwise expressly stated in the Supplier's invoice. With the successful payment to GetYourGuide, you have fulfilled your payment obligations towards the Supplier with a discharging effect. If claims are to be paid in a currency other than your local currency (foreign currency claim), GetYourGuide may (in its role as a commercial agent) collect payment in the your local currency and convert the foreign currency claim at the current exchange rate at the time of the conclusion of the contract. For highly volatile currencies, we may charge a reasonable exchange fee.

8.4 We are your contact in connection with a Service Agreement and payment therefore as the commercial agent of the Supplier. If you wish to request a refund of the Booking Price outside of our cancellation policy, you may contact us. We will then contact the Supplier, and the Supplier will determine in its discretion whether to honor the refund request. A refund granted by the Supplier can be processed by the Supplier through us.8.5 You must provide payment information truthfully and update it immediately in the event of changes. The means of payment permitted for the Activity will be displayed to you in the order process. The terms and conditions of the payment service provider will apply. Your payment service provider may charge additional fees. You are required to confirm to us that you are authorized to use or have the right to use a payment method you select.

8.6 In some cases you will not pay the Booking Price to GetYourGuide, or directly to the Supplier, but to another company that we have appointed to process the payment as a sub-agent. For example, if you live in the USA or use a credit card issued in the USA for payment, GetYourGuide Operations Inc, one of our subsidiaries, will process the payment. These payments are subject to the same terms and conditions as payments made directly to us, so nothing changes for you. You will have also fulfilled your payment obligations with the successful payment to the sub-agent with a discharging effect towards the Supplier. If you have questions relating to payment, you can contact our local customer service team via Contact us ⎸GetYourGuide.

8.7 By authorizing payment, you consent to your payment information being used to collect payment for the Supplier. We reserve the right to make the use of the payment function or individual payment methods on the GYG Platform dependent on a check of the required creditworthiness.

9. Changes and Cancellations9.1 You may only cancel the Service Agreements in accordance with the cancellation conditions as stated in the Supplier T&Cs, the description of the Activity on the GYG Platform, or on the voucher/ticket issued for the Activity.9.2 To avoid misunderstandings, you must make changes (e.g. rescheduling the Activity date or making changes to the participants) and cancellations via the GYG Platform, unless otherwise agreed. A cancellation or changes can be made via the form available at Contact us ⎸GetYourGuide. The change or cancellation must be made in good time; what is "in good time" depends on each individual case (e.g. within the applicable cancellation period) and may be subject to the Activity’s availability. Therefore, it is very important that you carefully read all terms and conditions on the Activity page or the Supplier T&Cs. The decisive factor for a timely cancellation is the timely receipt of the notification by GetYourGuide. If these conditions are met, we will issue a cancellation/change confirmation on behalf of the Supplier. This will serve as proof of the cancellation/change and therefore must be kept.9.3 We can notify you of changes or cancellations on behalf of the Supplier, especially if at short notice, by your provided telephone number and by sending changes to your email address.

9.4 Unless there are different cancellation conditions specified in the description of the Activity on the GYG Platform, in the Supplier  T&Cs, or on the Activity voucher/ticket, the following cancellation conditions shall apply:a) For cancellations more than 24 hours before the start of the Activity: full refund of the Booking Price; andb) For cancellations 24 hours or less before the start of the Activity or in case of no-show: no refund.

10. Reviews and Other User Content10.1 We offer you the opportunity to view reviews and other content posted by other users  on the GYG Platform. The reviews reflect the personal opinion of a respective user from a specific point in time and are therefore shaped by personal ideas and expectations. It must also be noted that the Activity may have changed since the review or other content was posted. The number of reviews and ratings given should also be taken into account, as a single opinion is often less meaningful than the synopsis of a large number of opinions.10.2 You can personally influence the content of the GYG Platform by writing reviews of Activities which you have purchased or posting pictures (together, "User Content"). You are fully responsible for the User Content you post. It is strictly forbidden to post User Content on the GYG Platform that: (i) is untrue or misleading; (ii) openly or covertly advertises products, services or companies; (iii) is created in return for remuneration from a third party; (iv) is created by or at the direction of the Supplier who provides the Activity; (v) violates the intellectual property, privacy, or other rights of a third party; or (vi) contains links or similar information/references that are likely to impair the functioning of third-party data processing systems.

10.3 You are obligated to ensure that you are entitled to the necessary rights of use for images before uploading the User Content. In particular, images or photos where we can see  other people  may only be uploaded to the GYG Platform if these persons gave their consent. If you want to use pictures that have been taken by a person other than you, you also need the consent of this person.

10.4 The public accessibility of the User Content may not violate legal provisions, morality and/or the rights of third parties; in particular, you may not upload and/or make publicly accessible any User Content with depictions of violence, pornography, discrimination, insults, racism, defamation or other illegal content or depictions.

10.5 You retain ownership of any User Content you create. You grant to GetYourGuide a non-exclusive, sublicensable (through one or more tiers), worldwide, fully-paid and royalty-free license, in any and all media now known or hereafter discovered or developed, to use, reproduce, adapt, translate, make derivative works of, modify, perform, publicly display, publicly perform, transmit, and distribute the User Content including (i) on or through the GetYourGuide Platform, (ii) on or through GetYourGuide’s partners, and (iii) in online and offline marketing materials.

10.6 We may remove User Content as necessary and at our sole discretion. For example, GetYourGuide may remove User Content if, in our opinion, it violates our obligations under Sections 9.2-9.4. We are not obligated to keep copies of User Content or to provide such copies.

10.7 GetYourGuide, its affiliates, sub-agents and their (distribution) partners, may display advertisements and other information next to or together with the User Content on the GYG Platform as well as on other media. You are not entitled to any compensation for such advertisements. We reserve the right to make changes to the type and scope of such advertising measures; we will not notify you of such changes.

11. Data protection11.1 All your personal data collected through the GYG Platform is processed by GetYourGuide as a data controller, in accordance with relevant data protection laws and for the purposes described in the Privacy Policy. GetYourGuide shares your personal data with Suppliers to the extent it is necessary for the performance of the Service Agreement between you and Supplier or when necessary to comply with a legal obligation and for other purposes legally allowed. Suppliers are independent data controllers and bear the sole responsibility of processing your personal data. 

11.2 You will find detailed information on how to exercise your data protection rights in the Privacy Policy.

12. Indemnification12.1 You shall fully indemnify us for all damages, costs and expenses (including reasonable legal defense costs) incurred by us, our agents, or partners as a result of:12.1.1 your intentional or negligent misrepresentation, act, or omission in connection with your use of the GYG Platform;12.1.2 your intentional or negligent non-compliance with the GYG GTC; or12.1.3 claims asserted by third parties arising out of or in connection with your access to or use of the GYG Platform that intentionally or negligently violates these GYG GTC.13. AssignmentYou may not transfer or assign your rights and/or obligations under these GYG GTC, except for any claim for damages.

14. Severability clauseShould individual provisions of these GYG GTC be or become void or ineffective in whole or in part, this shall not affect the validity of the remaining provisions. Statutory law shall take the place of any provisions of these GYG GTC that are not included or are invalid. If such statutory law is not available in the respective case or would lead to an unacceptable result, the parties shall enter into negotiations to replace the non-included or invalid provision with a valid provision that comes as close as possible to the economic purpose of the invalid provision.

15. Supplier - Service Agreement

15.1 Conclusion of contract with the Supplier 15.1.1 If you select and purchase an Activity on the GYG Platform, you conclude a contract directly with the Supplier. When concluding the contract, we act as the commercial agent of the Supplier. 

15.1.2 After checking the availability of the Activity, you add the respective Activity to the shopping cart by clicking the button "Add to cart". After clicking the button "Checkout", you will be asked for further mandatory information, in particular the payment method, which must be completed.15.1.3 By clicking the button "Pay now" at the end of the ordering process, you submit a binding offer to conclude a Service Agreement with the Supplier that will provide the Activity. You are bound to the offer for two working days. After receipt of the offer, we will send you an automatic order confirmation on behalf of the Supplier. This order confirmation does not constitute an acceptance of the offer.15.1.4  The Suppliers may provide their own terms and conditions in their respective listings on the GYG Platform ("Supplier T&Cs"). Please read these Supplier T&Cs carefully, because they may contain important information for you, e.g. regarding cancellation options or conditions. Nothing in the Supplier T&Cs shall affect your relationship with us, or our legal rights. In the event of a conflict between a provision of the Supplier T&Cs and a provision in Section 9 of the GYG GTC, the provision that is more beneficial to you shall govern the relationship between you and the Supplier.15.1.5 We accept the offer in the name and on behalf of the Supplier once you receive a booking confirmation issued in the name and on behalf of the Supplier and, if applicable, have access to a voucher or ticket (either a mobile voucher or a downloadable PDF voucher/ticket) and a payment confirmation. We reserve the right to accept or reject contract offers at our sole discretion.

15.1.6 The contract between you and the Supplier is not set out in a separate contract text. The content of the contract results from the ordered product (i.e. the description of the Activity selected by you), applicable provisions in Section 15 of these GYG GTC, and - if applicable - the Supplier T&Cs.

15.1.7 You must immediately check the order confirmation to ensure that all data has been entered correctly.15.2 Prices 

15.2.1 In most cases, Posted Prices quoted are inclusive of all taxes and fees.  However, it is possible that additional local taxes or fees are levied locally.  If additional taxes or fees will be levied locally, this will be disclosed in the description of the Activity.15.2.2 The Posted Prices set by the Suppliers may be subject to special provisions, for example, with regard to cancellations and the refund of payments. You must independently check before booking whether the respective Supplier prescribes deviating conditions.

15.3 Provision of the Activity 15.3.1 You must arrive on time at the meeting point indicated by the Supplier. Please also take note of the Supplier T&Cs. If you are traveling to the Activity from abroad, you are responsible for the necessary travel documents (passport, visa, etc.) and compliance with health or other requirements.15.3.2 The Booking Price does not include insurance of any type. You are responsible for obtaining sufficient insurance coverage. We strongly encourage you to obtain travel insurance, especially if you are booking an Activity that involves outdoor or high-risk activities.  We do not operate tours, employ guides, or set safety standards for Activities. 

15.3.3 Suppliers are independent contractors and not agents or employees of GetYourGuide. We are not liable for the acts, errors, omissions, representations, warranties, breaches, negligence, or misconduct of any Supplier, or for any personal injury, death, property damage, or other damages or expenses resulting therefrom or otherwise arising from any booking or Activity. 15.3.4 For time and deadline calculations, the time zone of the Supplier shall be decisive.

15.4 Further rights of the Supplier 

15.4.1 The Supplier may cancel the Activity on the agreed date without observing a cancellation period if weather conditions, official measures, strikes or other external circumstances that are unforeseeable or can only be averted by disproportionate efforts on the part of the Supplier and are beyond the Supplier's control (in particular events of force majeure) make it impossible or significantly impede or endanger the performance of the Activity. In this case, the Booking Price paid for the canceled Activity will be refunded. You may direct any additional compensation request directly to the Supplier according to 15.3.3.

15.4.2 The Supplier may exclude you from an Activity if (i) you do not meet the requirements for participation specified on the GYG Platform, (ii)  you would endanger yourself or others through your participation, or (iii) you disrupt the implementation of the Activity in any way. In these cases, the Booking Price paid for the Activity will not be refunded.

15.4.3 The Supplier may make immaterial changes to the program of the Activity at any time if this appears necessary due to circumstances arising at short notice. Insignificant program changes also include a change of the starting/meeting point for the Activity, provided that the new meeting point can be reached by the customer from the originally agreed meeting point on foot or by public transport within 15 minutes. A change of the start/meeting point is possible up to 24 hours before the start of the booked Activity and will be communicated to you by email or displayed via the GYG Platform.

B1 Warranty Disclaimers. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT ALLOWED BY APPLICABLE LAW AND EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH HEREIN, WE MAKE NO, AND HEREBY SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIM ANY, REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, REGARDING THE ACTIVITIES AND SERVICES CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT, INCLUDING ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY, OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES ARISING FROM COURSE OF DEALING, COURSE OF PERFORMANCE, OR USAGE OF TRADE. The GYG Platform is provided “as is,” without warranty of any kind, either express or implied. We do not warrant that (i) the GYG Platform will meet all of your requirements or that performance of the GYG Platform will be uninterrupted, virus-free, secure, or error-free, or (ii) the content on the GYG Platform will be complete, accurate, or free from technical defects or changes by unauthorized third parties. We are not responsible for the accuracy or completeness of Supplier-provided data. 

B2.1 Injury Incidents. You (and any other person for whom you made a booking for an Activity (a “Co-Traveller”)) agree and understand that Activities are provided by Suppliers, not by GetYourGuide. Suppliers are independent third parties that are not under the control of GetYourGuide. In the event that you or a Co-Traveller is injured, killed, or suffers a loss during or in connection with an Activity (an “Injury Incident”), you agree to seek compensation directly from the Supplier that provided the Activity, not from GetYourGuide or its affiliates, subsidiaries, distribution partners, or their respective officers, directors, employees and agents (the “GetYourGuide Parties”). 

B2.2 Release. YOU, ON BEHALF OF YOURSELF AND ANY CO-TRAVELLERS , HEREBY RELEASE THE GETYOURGUIDE PARTIES TO AND FROM ANY AND ALL CLAIMS, DEMANDS, CAUSES OF ACTION, OBLIGATIONS, DAMAGES, AND LIABILITIES, COSTS AND EXPENSES (INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ATTORNEYS FEES), WHETHER OR NOT NOW KNOWN, SUSPECTED, OR CLAIMED, RELATING TO ANY INJURY INCIDENT, WHICH YOU EVER HAD, NOW HAVE, OR MAY IN THE FUTURE HAVE. 

B2.3 Unknown Claims. California Civil Code section 1542 provides as follows: “A general release does not extend to claims that the creditor or releasing party does not know or suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of executing the release and that, if known by him or her, would have materially affected his or her settlement with the debtor or released party.” You agree that you have read and understand this language. You specifically and expressly WAIVE any and all rights you may have under California Civil Code section 1542 (or any similar statute) as they relate to the release in this section. You acknowledge and agree that this waiver is an essential and material term of these Terms.

B2.4  Covenant. You covenant and agree never to commence, prosecute, or cause, permit, or advise to be commenced or prosecuted against any GetYourGuide Party, any action at law or equity, or other proceedings (including arbitration), based upon any Injury Incident.  If any such prohibited action or proceeding is instituted, these Terms may be pleaded as a full and complete defense thereto.

B2.5. Third-Party Beneficiaries. The GetYourGuide Parties are expressly named as third-party beneficiaries to this Section B2. Each of the GetYourGuide Parties has the right to enforce this Section B2 against you as this Section B2 pertains to its respective rights as a third-party beneficiary.

B3.1 Waivers. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT ALLOWED BY APPLICABLE LAW, WE WILL BE NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, INCLUDING DAMAGES FOR LOST DATA, LOST PROFITS, LOST REVENUE OR COSTS OF PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR SERVICES, HOWEVER CAUSED AND UNDER ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, INCLUDING CONTRACT OR TORT (INCLUDING PRODUCTS LIABILITY, STRICT LIABILITY AND NEGLIGENCE), AND WHETHER OR NOT WE WERE OR SHOULD HAVE BEEN AWARE OR ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE AND NOTWITHSTANDING THE FAILURE OF ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY REMEDY STATED HEREIN. 

B3.2 Maximum. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT ALLOWED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IF GETYOURGUIDE IS HELD LIABLE FOR ANY LOSS OR DAMAGE ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THESE TERMS (INCLUDING YOUR USE OF GETYOURGUIDE’S SERVICES, YOUR PARTICIPATION (OR NON-PARTICIPATION) IN AN ACTIVITY, OR AN INJURY INCIDENT), THEN GETYOURGUIDE’S LIABILITY WILL IN NO EVENT EXCEED, IN THE AGGREGATE, THE GREATER OF (A) THE SUM PAID TO GETYOURGUIDE IN CONNECTION WITH THE ACTIVITY GIVING RISE TO THE CLAIM (IF APPLICABLE), OR (B) TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS (US $200.00).

B3.3 Allocation of Risk. THE PARTIES ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT THE PROVISIONS IN THIS SECTION B3 REPRESENT A REASONABLE ALLOCATION OF RISK AND THAT THE GETYOURGUIDE WOULD NOT ENTER INTO AN AGREEMENT ABSENT SUCH PROVISIONS. In no event shall we be liable to you for any acts or omissions of any Supplier. 

Please read this Section B4 carefully, it may affect your rights. This section provides for resolution of most disputes through arbitration instead of court trials.  Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court, uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, and discovery is more limited. Arbitration is final and binding and subject to only very limited review by a court. This Section B4 shall survive termination of your GYG Account.

B4.1 Binding Arbitration. This provision is intended to be interpreted broadly to encompass all disputes or claims arising out of or relating to the GYG Platform, our services, these GYG GTC, and your relationship with us (or our subsidiary, parent or affiliate company or companies), whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, including the interpretation and scope of this arbitration clause and the arbitrability of a dispute (collectively, “Claims”). All Claims will be resolved by binding arbitration, unless expressly excluded from arbitration as set forth in Section B4.4. 

B4.2 Opt Out. Notwithstanding Section B4.1, you may opt out of binding arbitration by following the Opt-Out Procedure here and mailing us a written notice, by the Opt Out Deadline. The opt-out notice must be postmarked no later than 30 calendar days after the earliest of (i) the date you first used the GYG Platform, (ii) the date you first used our services, or (iii) the date of your first transaction with us (“Opt Out Deadline”). 

The written notice must be sent to the following address: GetYourGuide Legal Department, Sonnenburger Straße 71-75, 10437 Berlin, Germany. Any opt-out received after the Opt Out Deadline (allowing three (3) additional days for mailing) will not be valid and you must pursue your claim in arbitration or small claims court.

B4.3 Governing Law for this Clause. The parties agree that these GYG GTC evidence a transaction in interstate commerce and this arbitration provision will be interpreted and enforced in accordance with the U.S. Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law, and not governed by state law.

B4.4 Excluded Claims. The following claims are not subject to binding arbitration and may be litigated in a judicial proceeding in a court of competent jurisdiction (as specified in Section B5): (i) any claim or cause of action alleging actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation, or violation of a party’s copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property rights; (ii) any claim or cause of action seeking emergency injunctive relief based on exigent circumstances (e.g., imminent danger of the commission of a crime, hacking, or cyber-attack); or (iii) a request for the remedy of public injunctive relief, where such remedies are permitted and cannot be waived by applicable law. In addition, either of us may take a claim to small claims court, if the claim qualifies for hearing by such a court, subject to the limitations specified in Section B5.

B4.5 Arbitration Process. For all disputes, whether pursued in court or arbitration, you must first send us a written description via a form available at Contact us ⎸GetYourGuide of your claim to allow us an opportunity to resolve the dispute. You may request arbitration if your claim or dispute is not resolved within 60 days of our receipt of the claim. The arbitration of any dispute or claim shall be conducted (i) before one neutral arbitrator, (ii) in English, (iii) under the Arbitration Rules of the International Chamber of Commerce (“ICC Rules”) together with the IBA Rules on the Taking of Evidence in International Commercial Arbitration (1999) (the “IBA Rules”) (where there is inconsistency, the IBA Rules shall prevail, but solely as regards the taking of evidence). Neither party is permitted to make any application pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1782. The arbitrator shall be empowered to award only those damages which are permitted in these GYG GTC, subject to any disclaimers or damages and liability limits set forth in these GYG GTC. The award rendered by the arbitrator shall include costs of the arbitration, reasonable attorneys’ fees and reasonable costs for experts and other witnesses. Any arbitration shall be confidential, and neither you nor we may disclose the existence, content, or results of any arbitration, except as may be required by law or for purposes of enforcement of the arbitration award. Judgment on any arbitration award may be entered in any court having proper jurisdiction. For claims under $25,000, the arbitration will not involve any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses but will instead be conducted based solely on written submissions, unless you request an in-person or telephone hearing, or the arbitrator determines that an in-person or telephone appearance is required. Hearings by telephone shall be preferred, unless the arbitrator determines that a party’s right to a fundamentally fair process would be impaired without an in-person hearing. In the case of an in-person hearing, the

hearing shall be conducted in New York, New York, unless otherwise ordered by the arbitrator.

B4.6 Class Action Waiver. YOU AND WE EACH AGREE THAT ANY PROCEEDING, WHETHER IN ARBITRATION OR IN COURT, WILL BE CONDUCTED ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT IN A CLASS, CONSOLIDATED OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION. If a court or arbitrator determines in an action between you and us that this class action waiver is unenforceable, this Section B4 will not apply to you. If you opt out of binding arbitration in accordance with Section B4.2, this class action waiver will not apply to you. Neither you, nor any other consumer, can be a class representative, class member, or otherwise participate in a class, consolidated or representative proceeding without having opted out of binding arbitration in accordance with Section B4.2. 

If any provision of this arbitration agreement is found unenforceable, the unenforceable provision will be severed and the remaining arbitration terms will be enforced.

B5 Governing Law. Except as specified in Section B4.3, these GYG GTC are governed by the laws of the State of New York, without regard to its conflict of laws rules. 

B6 Venue. Any legal suit, action, or proceeding arising out of or related to these GYG GTC or our services (including (i) any proceeding initiated by a User who has opted out of binding arbitration in accordance with Section B4.2, and (ii) any small claims proceeding) shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the State and Federal Courts located in Kings County, New York. Each party irrevocably consents to the personal jurisdiction of such courts and agrees that it is a convenient forum and that it will not seek to transfer such action or proceeding to any other forum or jurisdiction, under the doctrine of forum non conveniens or otherwise.

B7 Jury Waiver. IF FOR ANY REASON A CLAIM PROCEEDS IN COURT RATHER THAN THROUGH ARBITRATION, YOU AND WE EACH WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL.][ ]]]] ] []

The problems we are solving

The way we travel has changed. It's no longer about how we get there or where we sleep, but about the experiences we have. 

Finding those incredible things to do isn't always easy though, with 80% of the experiences market offline and largely fragmented. At GetYourGuide, we're changing that.

With more people exploring the world, rapid digitalization, and the increasing desire for unforgettable experiences, we’re in a unique position. And while the experiences market itself is huge, our opportunity extends beyond travel. We’re already building for what’s next and are leading the pack. Come join us on this exciting next step in our journey.Open roles
