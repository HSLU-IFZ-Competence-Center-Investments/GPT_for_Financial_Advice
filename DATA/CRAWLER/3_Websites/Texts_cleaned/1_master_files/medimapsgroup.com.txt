Osteoporosis has emerged as a major health concern in almost all industrialized countries.

Osteoporosis is a condition that can often go undetected until a fracture occurs. When left untreated, it can lead not only to significant pain but disability, and loss of independence.

30% of osteopenic patients are about the same risk of fracture as some of those who are osteoporotic and are potentially missed by bone densitometry alone (1). You need additional information about your bone quality. This can be assessed by Trabecular Bone Score.

WOMEN OVER THE AGES 50 WILL EXPERIENCES OSTEOPOROSIS FRACTURES*

OF FRACTURES ARE CAUSED BY OSTEOPOROSIS ANNUALLY
Why is TBS important to measure?

While BMD is currently the gold standard for the diagnosis of osteoporosis, it has its limitations since it only provides information on bone quantity. Unlike BMD, Trabecular Bone Score provides useful additional clinical information on bone microarchitecture. TBS Osteo provides a more comprehensive overview of your bone health.

Trabecular Bone Score can be obtained from a regular DXA examination. This allows your doctor to better evaluate your bone health for improved patient care.

 START TBS ORTHO PRODUCT PAGE 1 REVOLUTION SLIDER 6.3.0 

Bone quality assessment for surgical implants and procedures 

 is a medical imaging software technology, which will give orthopedic surgeons critical information on a patient’s trabecular bone microarchitecture. This will help them select the most appropriate procedures and implants and ensure optimal implant stability and outcome for hips, shoulders, spine or knee replacement surgery.

Since orthopaedic implants are fixed in the trabecular bone area, the quality of the bone itself matters. If it is fragile, implants can become loose, unstable or migrate, causing pain and reducing a patient’s mobility. A revision joint replacement surgery, a longer, more complicated procedure than the initial one, may have to be performed early on.

With the critical information provided by TBS, orthopaedic surgeons will be able to choose appropriate implants and procedures according to their patient’s bone quality. TBS Ortho may help reduce the number of revisions of joint replacements due to fragile bones; better predict implant failure; improve recovery time; save consultation and surgery time; justify incurred costs to the payers (insurances); justify procedures used in case of litigation.

How TBS Ortho can help

With the critical information provided by TBS, orthopaedic surgeons will be able to choose appropriate implants and procedures according to their patient’s bone quality. TBS Ortho may help reduce the number of revisions of joint replacements due to fragile bones; better predict implant failure; improve recovery time; save consultation and surgery time; justify incurred costs to the payers (insurances); justify procedures used in case of litigation.

Based on the analysis of regular 2D X-ray images, Cone Beam CT scans or regular CT scans, the TBS algorithm computes a specific score to assess the trabecular bone quality, which is related to its 3D-microarchitecture. Results are obtained with no additional patient radiation exposure nor scan time.

Navigating Secondary Osteoporosis in Cancer: A Scientific Perspective

While advancements in oncology have enhanced cancer care, they also underscore the importance of recognizing and managing potential side effects, such as secondary osteoporosis associated with specific treatments. This risk, if not proactively addressed, can result in fragility fractures, highlighting the need for vigilance in bone health, particularly among postmenopausal women who are susceptible to bone loss due to treatment and estrogen depletion. Ensuring a comprehensive understanding of these risks is vital to maintain patient health throughout and post-cancer therapy.

 START TBS OSTEO PRODUCT PAGE REVOLUTION SLIDER 6.3.0 

The gold standard for osteoporosis fracture risk assessment 

Providing the full bone health picture

Osteoporosis is a common disease characterised by low bone density and microarchitectural deterioration of bone tissue. Its consequences are an increase in bone fragility leading to an increased risk for fractures, especially of the hip, spine and wrist.

Moreover, while the measurement of Bone Mineral Density (BMD) is important in the diagnosis of osteoporosis, it has its own limitations. BMD alone cannot identify all patients who are at high risk of bone fracture. In fact, the Bone microarchitecture information is needed in order to provide a complete diagnostic.

NEW RELEASE - TBS OSTEO V3.1.2 (for Hologic DXAs)

REFERENCE CURVE
ADJUSTED TO TBSLEARN MORE 
TBS iNsight™ is the missing link to bone fracture risk prediction

TBS iNsight™ is Medimaps Group flagship software. This advanced imaging software application for bone densitometers (DXA) computes a Trabecular Bone Score (TBS), which provides extremely useful additional clinical information as to the microarchitecture of the bone. TBS iNsight™ helps capture an additional ~30% of patients at fracture risk*. Since January 2022 TBS is reimbursed in the USA.

*Adapted from Table 3 in Hans et al. J Bone Miner Res: 2011 Nov;26 (11):2762-9

Two patients with the same bone density (same BMD values) can have a different underlying bone microarchitecture (different TBS scores). They will not have the same fracture risk.

The combination of Trabecular Bone Score, BMD and clinical risk factors or FRAX provides a more comprehensive overview of a patient’s bone health. It improves fracture risk prediction, helps identify more patients at risk and fine-tune therapy decision.*

*Based on monitoring of changes of TBS across time.

How TBS Osteo can help

Medimaps developedto assess the microarchitectural deterioration of bone tissue – the second main characteristic of osteoporosis. It computes a Trabecular Bone Score (TBS), which provides extremely useful additional clinical information as to the microarchitecture of the bone.

How does TBS iNsight™ work?

Easily installed on a DXA machine, TBS iNsight™ uses the DXA 2-D images produced during a regular spine BMD scan to seamlessly computes a patient’s Trabecular Bone Score. This result is displayed in an automated report that can be edited and is easy to interpret by practitioners and requires no additional patient scan time and no additional radiation.

BOOK A DEMO 
Medicare reimbursement for TBS

Medicare reimbursement is currently possible for TBS iNsight™ (Osteo) for DXA. Trabecular Bone Score (TBS) procedures benefit from four dedicated Category 1 CPT® codes and can be paid through the Physician Fee Schedule (PFS) and the Hospital Outpatient Prospective Payment System (OPPS).

Home » TBS Osteo » Clinical Validation

The relevance of TBS has been assessed in more than 1200 peer-reviewed scientific papers and publications worldwide and the technology has been used with more than 250,000 patients.

You will find below key studies and publications on TBS by field of application. All publications will progressively be accessible on the Medimaps website.

TBS has proven very useful to assess and predict fragility fractures (current and future) independently of BMD, clinical risk factor and the -based risk estimates; and, when used in conjunction with any one of these measures, it consistently enhances their accuracy.
