Waveguides for AR/MR

For several years, NIL Technology has delivered masters for augmented and mixed reality (AR/MR) to some of the biggest players in the industry. 

We offer masters and sub-masters with blazed gratings, slanted gratings, and binary gratings. All three types of gratings can be combined in any ways and without any design constraints.

Surface relief waveguides for AR/MR are see-through waveguides, typically on high-refractive index glass. The waveguide includes surface relief gratings for in-coupling of the image signal from a projector, expansion in x and y, and out-coupling.

Typically, blazed- and slanted gratings are used for the coupling of light into the waveguide, and binary and slanted gratings are used for the pupil expansion and the out-coupling of the light.

NIL Technology makes high quality, custom-made slanted gratings with extremely high accuracy and excellent uniformity. We understand and appreciate the importance of low tapering, low roughness and distinct shape.

Slanted gratings are one of our specialities and we have extensive experience in making such high-quality gratings. The pitch, the aspect ratio and the slant angle can be tuned to meet your specifications.

Arrangement of slanted gratings in a waveguide display

Slanted gratings in optical applications

Slanted gratings are used in applications, where efficient redirecting of light is important. Currently, the main application of slanted gratings is for transparent waveguides in AR/MR head mounted displays, where light from an image generator is coupled into the waveguide at one end and coupled out of the waveguide and directed to the eye of the observer at the other end. The gratings act as high efficiency in- and out coupling gratings.

In addition to waveguides, slanted gratings may be used in any application, where high efficiency of a single diffraction order is desired.

Why choose NIL Technology to make your gratings

NIL Technology specializes in high-precision nanoscale features and complex optical structures. We have made gratings for many years and have ongoing, close relationships with major high-tech companies that use gratings for research & development, innovative new products and mass production.

Our competencies with slanted gratings include:Extreme accuracyExcellent uniformityFlat bottom of the trenchLow tapering (parallel walls)Low roughnessDistinct shape

NIL Technology is your partner throughout the whole journey, from idea to design and production of the optical part. We offer design, prototyping and manufacturing services, serving both large corporations and academic researchers.

Mastering of high quality gratings

NIL Technology has long and thorough experience in masters. We have refined the manufacturing processes to obtain slanted gratings with high planarity of the slant surfaces, horizontal top and bottom planes, and sharp corners between the surfaces.

Slanted grating masters from NILT do not suffer from rounded corners, warping of the planes, non-parallelism of the slant planes and non-horizontal top and bottom planes, as is the case of less advanced and optimized processed masters. Consequently, masters from NILT provides increased light control, less uncontrolled light scattering and in general second to none performance and efficiency.

Sub-masters and replication of gratings

The picture below shows a hard replica – a sub-master formed after an original master holding slanted gratings with two different tilt directions separated by only 5 µm. Both slant directions are simultaneously replicated to perfection.

A sub-master of slanted gratings with two opposite slant angles separated by 5 µm.Pitch: 600 nm, height: 375 nm, tilt angle: 30°.

Devices can be replicated directly from the sub-master or from higher generation sub-masters.

NILT slanted master with high planarity of the slant surfaces, horizontal top and bottom planes, and sharp corners between the surfaces.

 What are slanted gratings?

Slanted gratings are line gratings, where the profile of each line is tilted. It is in the group of gratings such as binary gratings, blazed gratings and multilevel gratings. The optical advantage of slanted gratings is that by proper choice of dimensions, tilt angle and material, almost all the light can be directed into a single diffraction order.

Micro and nano replication technologies are the cornerstones of NIL Technology

The starting point for micro and nanostructuring is a master with the desired surface relief structures. The structures on the master are defined by electron beam lithography and dry etching. Both are technologies that we have years of experience in, and that we have the needed advanced equipment and processes to offer a wide selection of different types of surface relief gratings.

We have access to a number of different lithography technologies for mastering and prototyping

Our core competences are within nanoimprint lithography, and electron beam lithography, but we are also experienced within  deep UV lithography, laser writing and UV contact lithography.  

Electron beam lithography, often referred to as e-beam lithography or EBL, is a versatile tool capable of making almost any kind of pattern imaginable within nanotechnology and with very small lateral dimensions.

We work primarily on Jeol JBX9500FSZ and Raith EBPG5200 systems.

NIL masters are most often patterned by electron beam lithography, in combination with a variety of pre- and post-processing as required.

Deep UV Lithography (DUV)

Deep UV lithography (in short DUV lithography) is an optical projection type lithography technique where the pattern on a reticle/mask is projected to the wafer surface through a 4X or 5X optical system. The wavelengths used for DUV lithography are 248 nm or 193 nm. DUV lithography is a high-speed lithographic technology suitable for large area masters of discrete components.

We work on two 248 nm DUV tools. The minimum achievable lateral dimensions with these tools are 200-250 nm.

Nanoimprint lithography is a contact technology where a surface relief pattern is transferred from a mold onto polymer material on a hard substrate. Subsequently, the residual layer is removed and the resulting polymer material is used as a mask for pattern transfer into the substrate.

NILT works primarily with thermal and UV NIL Technologies.

Replication is a proven high-volume manufacturing method for nanostructured components

Replication is the most used method in the production of next generation optical components from NILT’s advanced optical masters. This class of elements is also referred to as wafer level optics (WLO).

Replication is done with UV curable material or thermo plastic material. The advantage of UV curable materials is that they are reflow compatible and thereby most suitable for integration into modules with light sources, sensors, and other electronic components. Furthermore, UV curable materials allow for faster cycle times than thermo plastic materials.

NIL Technology makes high quality, custom-made slanted gratings with extremely high accuracy and excellent uniformity. We understand and appreciate the importance of low tapering, low roughness and distinct shape.

Slanted gratings are one of our specialities and we have extensive experience in making such high-quality gratings. The pitch, the aspect ratio and the slant angle can be tuned to meet your specifications.

Arrangement of slanted gratings in a waveguide display

Slanted gratings in optical applications

Slanted gratings are used in applications, where efficient redirecting of light is important. Currently, the main application of slanted gratings is for transparent waveguides in AR/MR head mounted displays, where light from an image generator is coupled into the waveguide at one end and coupled out of the waveguide and directed to the eye of the observer at the other end. The gratings act as high efficiency in- and out coupling gratings.

In addition to waveguides, slanted gratings may be used in any application, where high efficiency of a single diffraction order is desired.

Why choose NIL Technology to make your gratings

NIL Technology specializes in high-precision nanoscale features and complex optical structures. We have made gratings for many years and have ongoing, close relationships with major high-tech companies that use gratings for research & development, innovative new products and mass production.

Our competencies with slanted gratings include:Extreme accuracyExcellent uniformityFlat bottom of the trenchLow tapering (parallel walls)Low roughnessDistinct shape

NIL Technology is your partner throughout the whole journey, from idea to design and production of the optical part. We offer design, prototyping and manufacturing services, serving both large corporations and academic researchers.

Mastering of high quality gratings

NIL Technology has long and thorough experience in masters. We have refined the manufacturing processes to obtain slanted gratings with high planarity of the slant surfaces, horizontal top and bottom planes, and sharp corners between the surfaces.

Slanted grating masters from NILT do not suffer from rounded corners, warping of the planes, non-parallelism of the slant planes and non-horizontal top and bottom planes, as is the case of less advanced and optimized processed masters. Consequently, masters from NILT provides increased light control, less uncontrolled light scattering and in general second to none performance and efficiency.

Sub-masters and replication of gratings

The picture below shows a hard replica – a sub-master formed after an original master holding slanted gratings with two different tilt directions separated by only 5 µm. Both slant directions are simultaneously replicated to perfection.

A sub-master of slanted gratings with two opposite slant angles separated by 5 µm.Pitch: 600 nm, height: 375 nm, tilt angle: 30°.

Devices can be replicated directly from the sub-master or from higher generation sub-masters.

NILT slanted master with high planarity of the slant surfaces, horizontal top and bottom planes, and sharp corners between the surfaces.

 What are slanted gratings?

Slanted gratings are line gratings, where the profile of each line is tilted. It is in the group of gratings such as binary gratings, blazed gratings and multilevel gratings. The optical advantage of slanted gratings is that by proper choice of dimensions, tilt angle and material, almost all the light can be directed into a single diffraction order.

Copenhagen, Denmark, January 29, 2024 – NIL Technology (NILT), a leader in advanced optical solutions, is announcing metaEye™ an ultracompact metalens-based camera with applications for eye-tracking, smart locks, biometrics, SLAM and ubiquitous sensing across a range of applications including gaming, presence detection, and smart appliances. This revolutionary metalens camera uses a patent-pending lens architecture only possible with metalenses to deliver an ultra-compact form factor, good performance, and environmental robustness.

“This transformative metaEye™ design concept truly reveals the power of metalenses and will set new standards in the field of compact cameras and Rx modules for sensing and machine vision applications.”

Ulrich QuaadeHead of Optics, NIL Technology

The metaEye™ lens stack consists of meta-surfaces, apertures, anti-reflection coatings, and a bandpass filter integrated into a single cube. This lens cube can be bonded directly onto the cover-glass of the image-sensor, which makes for simple camera module assembly. The lens cube has an aggressive total track length of 1.7 mm. The metaEye™ lens matches the sensor CRA curve, leading to good light capture across the entire field of view and delivers good on-axis and off-axis MTF performance with light-emitting-diode (LED) illumination at 850 nm.

metaEye™ camera uses OMNIVISION’s OG0TB1B sensor with a pixel size of 2.2 microns and pixel array of 400×400. The camera module is barrel-free and measures 1.64 mm (width) x 1.64 mm (length) x 2.2 mm (height), including the sensor-CSP, lens, and the flex PCB. The metaEye™ module can be shipped on tape-and-reel, handled by a pick-and-place machine, and mounted onto the PCB using SMT reflow.

Micro and nano replication technologies are the cornerstones of NIL Technology

The starting point for micro and nanostructuring is a master with the desired surface relief structures. The structures on the master are defined by electron beam lithography and dry etching. Both are technologies that we have years of experience in, and that we have the needed advanced equipment and processes to offer a wide selection of different types of surface relief gratings.

We have access to a number of different lithography technologies for mastering and prototyping

Our core competences are within nanoimprint lithography, and electron beam lithography, but we are also experienced within  deep UV lithography, laser writing and UV contact lithography.  

Electron beam lithography, often referred to as e-beam lithography or EBL, is a versatile tool capable of making almost any kind of pattern imaginable within nanotechnology and with very small lateral dimensions.

We work primarily on Jeol JBX9500FSZ and Raith EBPG5200 systems.

NIL masters are most often patterned by electron beam lithography, in combination with a variety of pre- and post-processing as required.

Deep UV Lithography (DUV)

Deep UV lithography (in short DUV lithography) is an optical projection type lithography technique where the pattern on a reticle/mask is projected to the wafer surface through a 4X or 5X optical system. The wavelengths used for DUV lithography are 248 nm or 193 nm. DUV lithography is a high-speed lithographic technology suitable for large area masters of discrete components.

We work on two 248 nm DUV tools. The minimum achievable lateral dimensions with these tools are 200-250 nm.

Nanoimprint lithography is a contact technology where a surface relief pattern is transferred from a mold onto polymer material on a hard substrate. Subsequently, the residual layer is removed and the resulting polymer material is used as a mask for pattern transfer into the substrate.

NILT works primarily with thermal and UV NIL Technologies.

Replication is a proven high-volume manufacturing method for nanostructured components

Replication is the most used method in the production of next generation optical components from NILT’s advanced optical masters. This class of elements is also referred to as wafer level optics (WLO).

Replication is done with UV curable material or thermo plastic material. The advantage of UV curable materials is that they are reflow compatible and thereby most suitable for integration into modules with light sources, sensors, and other electronic components. Furthermore, UV curable materials allow for faster cycle times than thermo plastic materials.

Optical Design

NIL Technology creates design of optical modules,  single meta-optical elements, and diffractive optical elements

We typically use ray tracing software to optimize and simulate performance in module design. For example, we design metalens modules to optical specifications of e.g., field of view, total track length, distortion, modulation transfer function (MTF) etc. We also design other types of modules, for example dot projectors and flood illuminators.

For optical elements, we use in-house developed methods, based on accurately solving Maxwells equations to design metalenses, DOE lenses, diffusers, fan-out gratings, and other beam shaping or controlling elements. The strength of our in-house developed design tools is seen in the high fidelity of the output light profile, the vanishing 0-order and high efficiency of elements.

We have developed custom tools to interface the ray tracing models with our in-house rigorous design and simulation tools for diffractive and metaoptic surfaces. In this way, we can do full performance and Monte Carlo simulations, including actual meta or DOE designs.

NILT covers the full loop from initial design, prototyping, optical characterization, and if necessary one or more iterations to obtain the required function.

We put great effort in optical testing of elements and components that are manufactured

At our facilities in Denmark and Switzerland, we have state of the art optical labs to characterize functions of produced parts. We have equipment available to characterize optical functions, such as diffusers, fanouts, imaging cameras and more for visible or IR applications.

Besides initial testing of parts to confirm correct optical functions, our test strategy for production is initiated at the beginning of all projects to ensure delivery of high-quality optical components, according to customer expectations.

Optical testing is a key function to enable a fast feedback loop and cycle time, as well as high quality of shipped parts.

Mass Production

We mass produce optical elements and components. Based on our state-of-the-art masters, we manufacture advanced, high performing optical elements and components

Manufacturing of optical elements and components in NIL Technology is either done in-house or with manufacturing partners; it depends on technology, materials and volume. Manufacturing makes use of our high-quality masters, NILT approved and developed processes, as well as NILT approved and managed materials and suppliers. This enables us to unite high performance with high quality and industry standard long-term reliability.

Copenhagen, Denmark, January 29, 2024 – NIL Technology (NILT), a leader in advanced optical solutions, is announcing metaEye™ an ultracompact metalens-based camera with applications for eye-tracking, smart locks, biometrics, SLAM and ubiquitous sensing across a range of applications including gaming, presence detection, and smart appliances. This revolutionary metalens camera uses a patent-pending lens architecture only possible with metalenses to deliver an ultra-compact form factor, good performance, and environmental robustness.

“This transformative metaEye™ design concept truly reveals the power of metalenses and will set new standards in the field of compact cameras and Rx modules for sensing and machine vision applications.”

Ulrich QuaadeHead of Optics, NIL Technology

The metaEye™ lens stack consists of meta-surfaces, apertures, anti-reflection coatings, and a bandpass filter integrated into a single cube. This lens cube can be bonded directly onto the cover-glass of the image-sensor, which makes for simple camera module assembly. The lens cube has an aggressive total track length of 1.7 mm. The metaEye™ lens matches the sensor CRA curve, leading to good light capture across the entire field of view and delivers good on-axis and off-axis MTF performance with light-emitting-diode (LED) illumination at 850 nm.

metaEye™ camera uses OMNIVISION’s OG0TB1B sensor with a pixel size of 2.2 microns and pixel array of 400×400. The camera module is barrel-free and measures 1.64 mm (width) x 1.64 mm (length) x 2.2 mm (height), including the sensor-CSP, lens, and the flex PCB. The metaEye™ module can be shipped on tape-and-reel, handled by a pick-and-place machine, and mounted onto the PCB using SMT reflow.

Eye-tracking application: NILT’s ultra-compact camera can be designed for numerous applications. NILT has chosen to optimize this design for application in eye-tracking and iris recognition. Images and video captured with this metacube camera show high contrast and good resolution across the entire field of view when illuminated with an LED operating at 850 nm. The camera module operates over a large depth-of-field, making for good user experience. NILT will be demonstrating the metaEye™ camera at SPIE Photonics West 2024.

“OMNIVISION is a leader in BSI global-shutter sensors for compact cameras. We are pleased to support NIL Technology as they announce metaEye™ today. The OMNIVISION OG0TB1B sensor with NILT’s pioneering metalens architecture has an ultra-compact form factor and excellent performance, which addresses the needs of AR|VR|MR, and adjacent markets in automotive, smart-appliances, IoT, and computer vision.”

Devang PatelMarketing Director, IoT and Emerging Segment, OMNIVISION

“This pioneering metaEye™ lens, which integrates meta-surfaces, apertures, BPF, and ARC, is a significant innovation in metalens architecture. It is made possible by NILT’s vertical integration where we have design, mastering, and wafer-level-assembly working closely to maximize the overall performance.”

Optical Design

NIL Technology creates design of optical modules,  single meta-optical elements, and diffractive optical elements

We typically use ray tracing software to optimize and simulate performance in module design. For example, we design metalens modules to optical specifications of e.g., field of view, total track length, distortion, modulation transfer function (MTF) etc. We also design other types of modules, for example dot projectors and flood illuminators.

For optical elements, we use in-house developed methods, based on accurately solving Maxwells equations to design metalenses, DOE lenses, diffusers, fan-out gratings, and other beam shaping or controlling elements. The strength of our in-house developed design tools is seen in the high fidelity of the output light profile, the vanishing 0-order and high efficiency of elements.

We have developed custom tools to interface the ray tracing models with our in-house rigorous design and simulation tools for diffractive and metaoptic surfaces. In this way, we can do full performance and Monte Carlo simulations, including actual meta or DOE designs.

NILT covers the full loop from initial design, prototyping, optical characterization, and if necessary one or more iterations to obtain the required function.

We put great effort in optical testing of elements and components that are manufactured

At our facilities in Denmark and Switzerland, we have state of the art optical labs to characterize functions of produced parts. We have equipment available to characterize optical functions, such as diffusers, fanouts, imaging cameras and more for visible or IR applications.

Besides initial testing of parts to confirm correct optical functions, our test strategy for production is initiated at the beginning of all projects to ensure delivery of high-quality optical components, according to customer expectations.

Optical testing is a key function to enable a fast feedback loop and cycle time, as well as high quality of shipped parts.

Mass Production

We mass produce optical elements and components. Based on our state-of-the-art masters, we manufacture advanced, high performing optical elements and components

Manufacturing of optical elements and components in NIL Technology is either done in-house or with manufacturing partners; it depends on technology, materials and volume. Manufacturing makes use of our high-quality masters, NILT approved and developed processes, as well as NILT approved and managed materials and suppliers. This enables us to unite high performance with high quality and industry standard long-term reliability.  

As part of the manufacturing process, the optical components are exposed to detailed functional and performance testing, as well as visual inspection in multiple steps. The tight process control and fast performance feedback loop ensure a steady production output of products that meets specifications at a consistent high quality. 

Full compliance with reliability requirements guarantees that NILT products can seamlessly integrate with customers’ supply chain and manufacturing processes.

Record-setting performance of transmit metalenses

Copenhagen, Denmark, October 05, 2023 – NIL Technology (NILT), a leader in advanced optical solutions, is announcing a portfolio of metalens-based transmit-optics with record-setting performance. The portfolio includes two-in-one dot projectors, diffusers, polarization-sensitive optics, and application-specific solutions. All the transmit optics announced consist of a single nano-structured surface and work with non-collimated light sources. 

Applications that benefit from this innovation include automotive driver monitoring systems, short-distance Lidar, 3D sensing (iTOF and dTOF), biometrics, face recognition, and autonomous vehicle safety and navigation. 

The metalens-based dot-projectors consist of a single surface that collimates the light and projects the dot patterns. Delivering the functionality with a single surface enables compact dot-projector modules. The dot-projectors have more than 70% efficiency and less than 10% dot-uniformity-error. The metalens-based diffusers offer a wide field of illumination while delivering high efficiency and pronounced batwings at higher illumination angles. The diffusers are notable in the absence of a 0th-order transmission peak. 

The polarization-sensitive optics enable applications to leverage the emerging VCSELs with polarization control. Furthermore, the meta optics platform can be customized for application-specific illumination profiles.

The image shows the projected dot pattern from a single meta-surface that collimates the light and projects the dot patterns. The field of illumination is 70°x70° with 3×5 tiling. 

Illustration of a schematic module geometry that shows the simplicity of using a single optical surface to produce the dot pattern.

"NILT's has consistently reported the highest transmission efficiencies for metalenses. Our sophisticated design tools and vertically-integrated manufacturing means our customers get the highest performance in the "as-build" parts."

Dr. Ulrich QuaadeHead of Optics at NIL Technology

NILT’s transmit-optics metalenses are customizable, and parameters such as the field of illumination, batwing heights, the dot spacing, and tiling in the dot pattern can be designed specifically to customers’ requirements.

Metalenses offer a host of advantages over conventional refractive lenses

Metalenses, the revolutionary flat lens technology, offers significant advantages over conventional refractive lenses. In narrowband applications, such as VCSEL-illuminated applications, one metalens can replace 6 to 8 refractive surfaces, leading to ultra-compact modules that are also simpler to assemble. Metalenses can deliver multiple functionalities from a single meta-surface, such as collimation and dot generation, leading to simpler modules and higher assembly yield. In near-infrared, the metalenses are constructed using silicon-on-glass, which delivers thermal stability 100 times better than plastic lenses. Metalens technology brings the precision and process control of lithographic techniques to optics, delivering superior tolerance control resulting in minimal part-to-part variation in mass production.

Vertical integration delivers higher performance and faster time to market

NILT’s vertical integration delivers fast turnaround times for prototypes, customized solutions to meet customers’ exact needs, and mass production capacity.

Our solutions are powered by our in-house proprietary design algorithms, unique mastering capabilities, and wafer-level replication processes. The vertical integration enables rapid prototyping, which helps our customers quickly find the technology-product fit while eliminating the need to work with the CMOS fab processing eco-system. NILT can deliver prototype parts in 8 weeks and rapidly iterate with our customers to meet the demands of any application. We deliver the prototype parts from our facilities in Europe and our mass-production parts from our factory in Malaysia.

Vertical integration also means our designs are inherently designed for mass production, considering the mastering and nano-replication processes. Our electron beam lithography mastering and in-house wafer-based processing deliver consistent “as-built” part performance, leading to higher application-level performance.

"NILT is your one-stop-shop for all your meta optics needs. Our versatile metalens technology can be customized to the application's specific needs. We control everything in-house, from design to product shipment, and can deliver products to our customers' specifications quickly. Additionally, NILT's fabrication services can take your design, prototype it, and mass produce It."

Project funding: Innobooster (Innovationsfonden)

The IZADI- nano2industry project address injection moulding, casting and coating of pilots for the production of improved components with nanomaterials for automotive, construction and agricultural machinery. Nano-reinforced thermoplastics will be combined with nanotextured steel moulds to produce automotive parts with anti-scratch and enhanced aesthetic properties.

Project funding: H2020

Project website

Inspired from NIL Technology´s succesful desktop Compact NanoImprint (CNI) tool, we have developed a desktop Compact Polymer Bonder (CPB) tool to allow for easy work with polymer bonding, especially relevant for (LOC), microfluidics and micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS). The new CPB tool has full external monitoring, data collection and control. Test partners in the project are DTU Danchip (DK) and microresist technology (DE). Project funding: Markedsmodningsfonden

META-REFLECTORMETA-REFLECTOR aims at developing the next generation of meta-materials to produce optical solar reflectors to govern the thermos-optical properties of the interface between the spacecraft and the space environment. This will be achieved by large area patterning of photonic nanopatterns.Project funding: H2020Project website

PolyNanoThe PolyNano project is organized in a technology developing kernel with direct link to 6 biotechnology task, to develop and explore the potential of LoC technology in a push-pull mode between development of precision polymer mass fabrication and user/market need defined by cutting edge biotech research. The project is open to approach new opportunities being new innovation initiatives, stakeholders (public, private, academic and commercial), and forms a strong basis for the partners to enter future R&D consortia and networks, national as well as international.Project funding: Innovationsfonden (DK)

NEMIMost failures in pattern replication processes are caused by wear of forming and forging master tools. Tribology is the science applied for lowering the wear by developing advanced (nanostructured) coatings. However, even these coatings are subject to wear that manifest itself as changes in the mechanical properties of the master tool in the form of fractures, roughness changes (adhesion) or deformation of the 3D shape. Hence a careful examination of the surface structure is essential for validating the functionality of a master tool. A new instrument based on NEUTRAL helium atoms is strictly surface sensitive with no penetration into the bulk (the atoms interact with the outermost electronic layer on the surface). The energy of the atoms is less than 0.1 eV, 4-6 order of magnitudes less than typical electron and helium ion energies. The new technique can image down to 10 nm and has the potential of being fast and applicable over large areas.Project funding: EU-FP7Project website

FASTFAST is a SME instrument phase 1 project with the aim to develop an elaborate business plan for NIL Technology´s Functionality by Structure technology. NILT has received funding for exploring and assessing the commercial potential of our breakthrough innovation.Project funding: H2020

SuperlensThe aim of the Superlens project is to develop a fabrication method for optical plastic lenses with self-cleaning properties. Plastic lenses are found in products ranging from medical devices to sensor and illumination systems. A great challenge of the existing lenses is the limited lifetime and need for cleaning. The project address this problem by creating super-hydrophobic and self-cleaning plastic lenses produced by injection moulding. The solution is to use nanostructured steel tools which will replicate the desired properties into the lens directly.Project funding: Eurostars-Eureka

Plast4FutureThe objective of the project is to upgrade existing injection moulding production technology for manufacture of plastic components by enhancing the lateral resolution on free-form surfaces down to micro- and nanometer length scales. This will be achieved through the development of a complete nanoimprint lithography solution for structuring the free-form surface of injection moulding tools and tool inserts. This will enable a cost effective and flexible nanoscale manufacturing process that can easily be integrated with conventional mass production lines.Project funding: EU-FP7Project website

CELL-O-MATICThe CELL-O-MATIC project will synergize efforts from SMEs, academics and large companies to develop a new chip-based technology for processing DNA from individual cells that will enhance the quality and throughput of present and future DNA sequencing significantly. This will open up for the next generation high-throughput sequencing. Especially in cancer management will single-cell analysis have many applications as DNA isolation and sequencing from tumour tissue and circulating tumour cells (CTC) has an important prognostic value.Project funding: EU-FP7

NanoPlastNanoPlast is an elaborate advanced technology platform for creation of novel surface functionalities in plastic products. Self-cleaning plastic surfaces, plastic surfaces with special optical properties and colorful plastic surfaces created without the use of dyes. The idea is that the parts are injection moulded in moulds with nanostructured surfaces, so that the nanostructures are transferred – “cast” – to the surfaces of the replicated plastic parts. The project is organized under The Danish National Advanced Technology Foundation.Project funding: Innovationsfonden (DK)

ICONThe project uses nanoimprint technology to create anti-microbial surfaces. The surfaces can reduce infections caused by pathogens such as S. aureus and E. coli and can be used on common plastics, medical devices, lenses and even ship hulls. Conventional methods for preventing bacterial surface attachment may use potentially harmful metal ions, nanoparticles, chemicals or UV-radiation.Project funding: ICON – A*STAR’s Industrial Consortium On Nanoimprint (SG)Project website

NILSAWNILSAW is a Eurostar funding European project, which is focussing on developing novel surface acoustic wave components through implementation of nanoimprint lithography techniques.The NILSAW target applications are calibration free SAW temperature sensors and SAW based osciallators for the tele/space/communication areas.  Nanoimprint lithography will allow the production of highly uniform SAW components, with a target of reducing the fabrication tolerances below 10 ppm.  Furthermore, Nanoimprint lithography allows for reduction of IDT features in order to push the production of high freuqency SAW components beyond the 2.5 GHz range, whcih is the upper limit in commercially available SAW components today.Project funding: EuroStars (EU)

NIL-2-GOThe NIL-2-GO project is focussed towards the development of a simple nanotechnological production technology for nanostructuring of fragile and rough surfaces. NIL-2-GO is based on a close collaboration between DTU Nanotech and NIL Technology ApS, and is so far the result of seven years research and development. In the project a simple method for nanostructuring of fragile and rough surfaces is made ready for production.Project funding: Innovationsfonden (DK)Project website

NaPANILThe NaPANIL project aims to develop processes, materials and tools, both for manufacturing and for control, for truly 3-dimensional nanosurfaces with feature dimensions ranging from 50 nm to several m. The nanosurfaces will be realised using various variants of nanoimprinting lithography. The dedicated application is to control light at nanostructured surfaces and a few potential high impact products have been identified by the end-user partners in the consortium. Design, demonstration and prototyping these applications will act as test-bench for the new manufacturing paradigm. The manufacturing processes possess generic aspects for production of any kind of topographically 3-dimensional nanostructured surfaces. In the R&D of nanoimprinting Europe has a leading position. The NaPANIL consortium combines the best expertise and know how in field to reach the goals in the project.Project funding: EU-FP7Project website

BISNES – Bio-Inspired Self-assembled Nano-Enabled SurfacesAdvanced nanofabrication can produce now nano-structures similar in size with single biomolecules or their self-assembled architectures. Capitalising on this strategic opportunity, BISNES focuses on the design, fabrication and implementation of biomimetic nanostructures which complement biomolecular surfaces and modulate the biomolecular activity. The BISNES project will (i) develop software products for the representation and quantification of bimolecular surfaces, especially those that self-assemble in long-range nano-aggregates, interacting with artificial nanostructures; (ii) design and fabricate nanostructured surfaces and objects that complementary replicate biomolecular surfaces; and (iii) design, fabricate and implement novel hybrid bio-devices which exhibit quantum-leap increase in capabilities (e.g., sensitivity, response time, cost) or entirely new ones.Project funding: EU FP7Project website

Optical Design

NIL Technology creates design of optical modules,  single meta-optical elements, and diffractive optical elements

We typically use ray tracing software to optimize and simulate performance in module design. For example, we design metalens modules to optical specifications of e.g., field of view, total track length, distortion, modulation transfer function (MTF) etc. We also design other types of modules, for example dot projectors and flood illuminators.

For optical elements, we use in-house developed methods, based on accurately solving Maxwells equations to design metalenses, DOE lenses, diffusers, fan-out gratings, and other beam shaping or controlling elements. The strength of our in-house developed design tools is seen in the high fidelity of the output light profile, the vanishing 0-order and high efficiency of elements.

We have developed custom tools to interface the ray tracing models with our in-house rigorous design and simulation tools for diffractive and metaoptic surfaces. In this way, we can do full performance and Monte Carlo simulations, including actual meta or DOE designs.

NILT covers the full loop from initial design, prototyping, optical characterization, and if necessary one or more iterations to obtain the required function.

We put great effort in optical testing of elements and components that are manufactured

At our facilities in Denmark and Switzerland, we have state of the art optical labs to characterize functions of produced parts. We have equipment available to characterize optical functions, such as diffusers, fanouts, imaging cameras and more for visible or IR applications.

Besides initial testing of parts to confirm correct optical functions, our test strategy for production is initiated at the beginning of all projects to ensure delivery of high-quality optical components, according to customer expectations.

Optical testing is a key function to enable a fast feedback loop and cycle time, as well as high quality of shipped parts.

Mass Production

We mass produce optical elements and components. Based on our state-of-the-art masters, we manufacture advanced, high performing optical elements and components

Manufacturing of optical elements and components in NIL Technology is either done in-house or with manufacturing partners; it depends on technology, materials and volume. Manufacturing makes use of our high-quality masters, NILT approved and developed processes, as well as NILT approved and managed materials and suppliers. This enables us to unite high performance with high quality and industry standard long-term reliability.  

As part of the manufacturing process, the optical components are exposed to detailed functional and performance testing, as well as visual inspection in multiple steps. The tight process control and fast performance feedback loop ensure a steady production output of products that meets specifications at a consistent high quality. 

Full compliance with reliability requirements guarantees that NILT products can seamlessly integrate with customers’ supply chain and manufacturing processes.

Record-setting performance of transmit metalenses

Copenhagen, Denmark, October 05, 2023 – NIL Technology (NILT), a leader in advanced optical solutions, is announcing a portfolio of metalens-based transmit-optics with record-setting performance. The portfolio includes two-in-one dot projectors, diffusers, polarization-sensitive optics, and application-specific solutions. All the transmit optics announced consist of a single nano-structured surface and work with non-collimated light sources. 

Applications that benefit from this innovation include automotive driver monitoring systems, short-distance Lidar, 3D sensing (iTOF and dTOF), biometrics, face recognition, and autonomous vehicle safety and navigation. 

The metalens-based dot-projectors consist of a single surface that collimates the light and projects the dot patterns. Delivering the functionality with a single surface enables compact dot-projector modules. The dot-projectors have more than 70% efficiency and less than 10% dot-uniformity-error. The metalens-based diffusers offer a wide field of illumination while delivering high efficiency and pronounced batwings at higher illumination angles. The diffusers are notable in the absence of a 0th-order transmission peak. 

The polarization-sensitive optics enable applications to leverage the emerging VCSELs with polarization control. Furthermore, the meta optics platform can be customized for application-specific illumination profiles.

The image shows the projected dot pattern from a single meta-surface that collimates the light and projects the dot patterns. The field of illumination is 70°x70° with 3×5 tiling. 

Illustration of a schematic module geometry that shows the simplicity of using a single optical surface to produce the dot pattern.

"NILT's has consistently reported the highest transmission efficiencies for metalenses. Our sophisticated design tools and vertically-integrated manufacturing means our customers get the highest performance in the "as-build" parts."

Dr. Ulrich QuaadeHead of Optics at NIL Technology

NILT’s transmit-optics metalenses are customizable, and parameters such as the field of illumination, batwing heights, the dot spacing, and tiling in the dot pattern can be designed specifically to customers’ requirements.

Metalenses offer a host of advantages over conventional refractive lenses

Metalenses, the revolutionary flat lens technology, offers significant advantages over conventional refractive lenses. In narrowband applications, such as VCSEL-illuminated applications, one metalens can replace 6 to 8 refractive surfaces, leading to ultra-compact modules that are also simpler to assemble. Metalenses can deliver multiple functionalities from a single meta-surface, such as collimation and dot generation, leading to simpler modules and higher assembly yield. In near-infrared, the metalenses are constructed using silicon-on-glass, which delivers thermal stability 100 times better than plastic lenses. Metalens technology brings the precision and process control of lithographic techniques to optics, delivering superior tolerance control resulting in minimal part-to-part variation in mass production.

Vertical integration delivers higher performance and faster time to market

NILT’s vertical integration delivers fast turnaround times for prototypes, customized solutions to meet customers’ exact needs, and mass production capacity.

Our solutions are powered by our in-house proprietary design algorithms, unique mastering capabilities, and wafer-level replication processes. The vertical integration enables rapid prototyping, which helps our customers quickly find the technology-product fit while eliminating the need to work with the CMOS fab processing eco-system. NILT can deliver prototype parts in 8 weeks and rapidly iterate with our customers to meet the demands of any application. We deliver the prototype parts from our facilities in Europe and our mass-production parts from our factory in Malaysia.

Vertical integration also means our designs are inherently designed for mass production, considering the mastering and nano-replication processes. Our electron beam lithography mastering and in-house wafer-based processing deliver consistent “as-built” part performance, leading to higher application-level performance.

"NILT is your one-stop-shop for all your meta optics needs. Our versatile metalens technology can be customized to the application's specific needs. We control everything in-house, from design to product shipment, and can deliver products to our customers' specifications quickly. Additionally, NILT's fabrication services can take your design, prototype it, and mass produce It."

Photonics Spectra Article: Waveguide Designs Bring Extended Reality into Sight

January 2024 – Photonics Spectra has written an article which discusses the future of alternative, virtual, and mixed reality hinges on waveguide designs that can deliver user comfort, high functionality, and low cost. 

With contributions from NIL Technologies, Lumus, Digilens,VividQ, Inprentus, and in particular, Andreas Georgiou, a Microsoft researcher and optical engineer with Reality Optics in Cambridge, the view is that extended and mixed reality is indeed in sight. 

NIL Technology, which introduced its first diffractive gratings for AR in 2008, is seeing customers continuously request more advanced nanostructures to optimize their display performance. 

“At the same time, customers are, to a constantly higher degree, designing for manufacturing both from a mastering and a replication point of view.”

Theodor NielsenCEO & Founder of NIL Technology

Project funding: Innobooster (Innovationsfonden)

The IZADI- nano2industry project address injection moulding, casting and coating of pilots for the production of improved components with nanomaterials for automotive, construction and agricultural machinery. Nano-reinforced thermoplastics will be combined with nanotextured steel moulds to produce automotive parts with anti-scratch and enhanced aesthetic properties.

Project funding: H2020

Project website

Inspired from NIL Technology´s succesful desktop Compact NanoImprint (CNI) tool, we have developed a desktop Compact Polymer Bonder (CPB) tool to allow for easy work with polymer bonding, especially relevant for (LOC), microfluidics and micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS). The new CPB tool has full external monitoring, data collection and control. Test partners in the project are DTU Danchip (DK) and microresist technology (DE). Project funding: Markedsmodningsfonden

META-REFLECTORMETA-REFLECTOR aims at developing the next generation of meta-materials to produce optical solar reflectors to govern the thermos-optical properties of the interface between the spacecraft and the space environment. This will be achieved by large area patterning of photonic nanopatterns.Project funding: H2020Project website

PolyNanoThe PolyNano project is organized in a technology developing kernel with direct link to 6 biotechnology task, to develop and explore the potential of LoC technology in a push-pull mode between development of precision polymer mass fabrication and user/market need defined by cutting edge biotech research. The project is open to approach new opportunities being new innovation initiatives, stakeholders (public, private, academic and commercial), and forms a strong basis for the partners to enter future R&D consortia and networks, national as well as international.Project funding: Innovationsfonden (DK)

NEMIMost failures in pattern replication processes are caused by wear of forming and forging master tools. Tribology is the science applied for lowering the wear by developing advanced (nanostructured) coatings. However, even these coatings are subject to wear that manifest itself as changes in the mechanical properties of the master tool in the form of fractures, roughness changes (adhesion) or deformation of the 3D shape. Hence a careful examination of the surface structure is essential for validating the functionality of a master tool. A new instrument based on NEUTRAL helium atoms is strictly surface sensitive with no penetration into the bulk (the atoms interact with the outermost electronic layer on the surface). The energy of the atoms is less than 0.1 eV, 4-6 order of magnitudes less than typical electron and helium ion energies. The new technique can image down to 10 nm and has the potential of being fast and applicable over large areas.Project funding: EU-FP7Project website

FASTFAST is a SME instrument phase 1 project with the aim to develop an elaborate business plan for NIL Technology´s Functionality by Structure technology. NILT has received funding for exploring and assessing the commercial potential of our breakthrough innovation.Project funding: H2020

SuperlensThe aim of the Superlens project is to develop a fabrication method for optical plastic lenses with self-cleaning properties. Plastic lenses are found in products ranging from medical devices to sensor and illumination systems. A great challenge of the existing lenses is the limited lifetime and need for cleaning. The project address this problem by creating super-hydrophobic and self-cleaning plastic lenses produced by injection moulding. The solution is to use nanostructured steel tools which will replicate the desired properties into the lens directly.Project funding: Eurostars-Eureka

Plast4FutureThe objective of the project is to upgrade existing injection moulding production technology for manufacture of plastic components by enhancing the lateral resolution on free-form surfaces down to micro- and nanometer length scales. This will be achieved through the development of a complete nanoimprint lithography solution for structuring the free-form surface of injection moulding tools and tool inserts. This will enable a cost effective and flexible nanoscale manufacturing process that can easily be integrated with conventional mass production lines.Project funding: EU-FP7Project website

CELL-O-MATICThe CELL-O-MATIC project will synergize efforts from SMEs, academics and large companies to develop a new chip-based technology for processing DNA from individual cells that will enhance the quality and throughput of present and future DNA sequencing significantly. This will open up for the next generation high-throughput sequencing. Especially in cancer management will single-cell analysis have many applications as DNA isolation and sequencing from tumour tissue and circulating tumour cells (CTC) has an important prognostic value.Project funding: EU-FP7

NanoPlastNanoPlast is an elaborate advanced technology platform for creation of novel surface functionalities in plastic products. Self-cleaning plastic surfaces, plastic surfaces with special optical properties and colorful plastic surfaces created without the use of dyes. The idea is that the parts are injection moulded in moulds with nanostructured surfaces, so that the nanostructures are transferred – “cast” – to the surfaces of the replicated plastic parts. The project is organized under The Danish National Advanced Technology Foundation.Project funding: Innovationsfonden (DK)

ICONThe project uses nanoimprint technology to create anti-microbial surfaces. The surfaces can reduce infections caused by pathogens such as S. aureus and E. coli and can be used on common plastics, medical devices, lenses and even ship hulls. Conventional methods for preventing bacterial surface attachment may use potentially harmful metal ions, nanoparticles, chemicals or UV-radiation.Project funding: ICON – A*STAR’s Industrial Consortium On Nanoimprint (SG)Project website

NILSAWNILSAW is a Eurostar funding European project, which is focussing on developing novel surface acoustic wave components through implementation of nanoimprint lithography techniques.The NILSAW target applications are calibration free SAW temperature sensors and SAW based osciallators for the tele/space/communication areas.  Nanoimprint lithography will allow the production of highly uniform SAW components, with a target of reducing the fabrication tolerances below 10 ppm.  Furthermore, Nanoimprint lithography allows for reduction of IDT features in order to push the production of high freuqency SAW components beyond the 2.5 GHz range, whcih is the upper limit in commercially available SAW components today.Project funding: EuroStars (EU)

NIL-2-GOThe NIL-2-GO project is focussed towards the development of a simple nanotechnological production technology for nanostructuring of fragile and rough surfaces. NIL-2-GO is based on a close collaboration between DTU Nanotech and NIL Technology ApS, and is so far the result of seven years research and development. In the project a simple method for nanostructuring of fragile and rough surfaces is made ready for production.Project funding: Innovationsfonden (DK)Project website

NaPANILThe NaPANIL project aims to develop processes, materials and tools, both for manufacturing and for control, for truly 3-dimensional nanosurfaces with feature dimensions ranging from 50 nm to several m. The nanosurfaces will be realised using various variants of nanoimprinting lithography. The dedicated application is to control light at nanostructured surfaces and a few potential high impact products have been identified by the end-user partners in the consortium. Design, demonstration and prototyping these applications will act as test-bench for the new manufacturing paradigm. The manufacturing processes possess generic aspects for production of any kind of topographically 3-dimensional nanostructured surfaces. In the R&D of nanoimprinting Europe has a leading position. The NaPANIL consortium combines the best expertise and know how in field to reach the goals in the project.Project funding: EU-FP7Project website

BISNES – Bio-Inspired Self-assembled Nano-Enabled SurfacesAdvanced nanofabrication can produce now nano-structures similar in size with single biomolecules or their self-assembled architectures. Capitalising on this strategic opportunity, BISNES focuses on the design, fabrication and implementation of biomimetic nanostructures which complement biomolecular surfaces and modulate the biomolecular activity. The BISNES project will (i) develop software products for the representation and quantification of bimolecular surfaces, especially those that self-assemble in long-range nano-aggregates, interacting with artificial nanostructures; (ii) design and fabricate nanostructured surfaces and objects that complementary replicate biomolecular surfaces; and (iii) design, fabricate and implement novel hybrid bio-devices which exhibit quantum-leap increase in capabilities (e.g., sensitivity, response time, cost) or entirely new ones.Project funding: EU FP7Project website

We make masters for DOEs in silicon and fused silica. We have no fundamental limits to how deep and how many levels we can make.

Masters are used directly in the replication process or to generate sub-masters. In some cases, generations of sub-masters for volume manufacturing by wafer-level replication.

From a DOE master, we can also make nickel shims for use e.g. in an injection molding-based volume manufacturing setup.

Diffractive optical elements and applications

Diffractive optics has the advantage of enhancing the value of laser systems. The technology has many functions and is useful for many types of applications. 

For example, you can find diffractive optics in long-range distance sensors like LiDAR / LADAR (Light Detection And Ranging), short-range distance sensors, position sensors, motion detection, and projection systems.

Beam shaping, beam splitting, diffusers, pattern projections, diffractive focusing lenses, and gratings are just some of the diffractive optics that we are working with. However, it is not just laser systems that benefit from DOEs. Systems based on other light sources can also benefit from diffractive optics even though it is broadband light sources.

You can read more about optical applications here.

 What are diffractive optical elements anyway?

Diffractive optical elements (DOEs) are optical components made of structures with dimensions comparable to the wavelength in complex arrangements. Based on the types of application, DOEs are capable of manipulating an incident light’s phase and amplitude with the purpose of creating a desired output pattern with a unique functionality.

Diffractive optics with a given function follows the same principles as a diffractive grating with a repetitive pattern of two or more levels, formed on the surface of a substrate – typically etched into the surface of a hard substrate or replicated in a polymer on the surface of a substrate or made purely in polymer. The depth of the pattern is in the order of the wavelength of the light, specific to the application, adjusted to the refractive index of the material of the DOE.
 Benefits of diffractive optics

Nowadays, with the aid of high accuracy advanced micro and nanolithography fabrication techniques, diffractive optics can be engineered with feature sizes ranging from a few hundred nanometers.

Introducing DOEs into classical optical systems can make them smaller and lighter since the diffractive optics are much thinner and lighter optical components compared to their bulky refractive counterparts.

Replacing refractive optical systems with systems based on DOEs, can both add functionality while maintaining high efficiency, drive down the cost and shrink the module size which are all crucial factors for integrated optics.

Our ability to take customers’ requirements and turn them into optical solutions optimized over the entire process chain differentiates us from others.

NILT MOE produced by nanoimprint lithography

Metalenses are flat lens technology made by optical components that use meta surfaces to manipulate light. They are used in optical applications that take advantage of the flat surface and reduced thickness, compared to classic, curved refractive lenses mainly used in optical devices today.
 How are metalenses used in optical applications?

In optical applications, metalenses can both illuminate (Tx-side) and image (Rx-side) the scene. On the Tx-side, the illumination can be flood-illuminated by diffusers or dot-projected using fan-out optics. On the Rx-side, the imaging lenses deliver similar functionality using fewer lens elements. Current commercial metalenses are focused on narrowband applications such as near-infrared (NIR), short wavelength infrared (SWIR), and narrowband visible, while broadband technology is being developed.
 What is the difference between a refractive lens and a metalens?

In a classical refractive lens, the phase function of the lens is delivered by a continuous curved surface. This refractive lens phase function spans over multiples of the 2p. In a diffractive lens, the lens operates in modulo-2p, where the Nx2p phase values are mapped back to 2p and implemented accordingly. In meta-optics, this modulo-2p phase function is implemented using nanostructures, which are significantly smaller than the wavelength of light. This allows metalenses to deliver functionality like refractive lenses while offering new lens capabilities and trade spaces.

NIL Technology has a whole process chain under one roof for design, mastering, prototyping, testing and characterization, and manufacturing capabilities of meta optics.

NIL Technology has profound and proven experience designing and developing advanced optics by manufacturing micro-and nano-patterned surface relief structures and more than 50 years of experience of cumulative expertise in thermal and UV NIL.

We leverage our extensive experience as a leader in nanostructured mastering and fast prototyping turnaround to deliver mass production metalens solutions.

Optical Design

NIL Technology creates design of optical modules,  single meta-optical elements, and diffractive optical elements

We typically use ray tracing software to optimize and simulate performance in module design. For example, we design metalens modules to optical specifications of e.g., field of view, total track length, distortion, modulation transfer function (MTF) etc. We also design other types of modules, for example dot projectors and flood illuminators.

For optical elements, we use in-house developed methods, based on accurately solving Maxwells equations to design metalenses, DOE lenses, diffusers, fan-out gratings, and other beam shaping or controlling elements. The strength of our in-house developed design tools is seen in the high fidelity of the output light profile, the vanishing 0-order and high efficiency of elements.

We have developed custom tools to interface the ray tracing models with our in-house rigorous design and simulation tools for diffractive and metaoptic surfaces. In this way, we can do full performance and Monte Carlo simulations, including actual meta or DOE designs.

NILT covers the full loop from initial design, prototyping, optical characterization, and if necessary one or more iterations to obtain the required function.

We put great effort in optical testing of elements and components that are manufactured

At our facilities in Denmark and Switzerland, we have state of the art optical labs to characterize functions of produced parts. We have equipment available to characterize optical functions, such as diffusers, fanouts, imaging cameras and more for visible or IR applications.

Besides initial testing of parts to confirm correct optical functions, our test strategy for production is initiated at the beginning of all projects to ensure delivery of high-quality optical components, according to customer expectations.

Optical testing is a key function to enable a fast feedback loop and cycle time, as well as high quality of shipped parts.

Mass Production

We mass produce optical elements and components. Based on our state-of-the-art masters, we manufacture advanced, high performing optical elements and components

Manufacturing of optical elements and components in NIL Technology is either done in-house or with manufacturing partners; it depends on technology, materials and volume. Manufacturing makes use of our high-quality masters, NILT approved and developed processes, as well as NILT approved and managed materials and suppliers. This enables us to unite high performance with high quality and industry standard long-term reliability.  

As part of the manufacturing process, the optical components are exposed to detailed functional and performance testing, as well as visual inspection in multiple steps. The tight process control and fast performance feedback loop ensure a steady production output of products that meets specifications at a consistent high quality. 

Full compliance with reliability requirements guarantees that NILT products can seamlessly integrate with customers’ supply chain and manufacturing processes.

Illustration of the diffraction of light by a binary line grating and a blazed grating. It is for this particular example assumed that b=Λ /2 and d=λ /(2(n-1)) which gives a phaseshift in the light by ϕ=2π(n-1)d/λ=π. Therefore, light will only be diffracted in odd diffraction orders. 

 Use of custom made diffraction gratings

The shape, pitch and depth of the structures, as well as the wavelength of the light, determine the diffraction properties of the gratings. The parameters can be chosen depending on the application the grating will used for. Our custom made diffraction gratings include both binary line gratings, blazed gratings and slanted gratings.

Binary line gratings are typically used for spectrometerss. Since the diffraction angle is dependent on the wavelength of the incoming light, every wavelength will be diffracted in slightly different directions. This of course demand a high degree of uniformity and symmetry to achieve high efficiency.

Blazed and slanted gratings are commonly applied as incoupling gratings for waveguides used in AR/VR/MR displays.

For these types of gratings, the slant and blaze angle control the diffraction angle while depth and pitch accuracy determines the efficiency. The optical response of the binary grating compared to a blazed grating is illustrated in the figure below. Binary line gratings diffract light in several directions due to the symmetry of the structure, whereas blazed and slanted gratings diffract in a single direction.   

Click on headline to read more our custom diffraction gratings 

What are diffraction gratings?

Diffraction gratings are periodic structures that diffracts light in only a certain number of discrete directions. For example, if you shine laser light through a diffraction grating and onto a wall, you will just see a number of spots on the wall.

The angular location of the spots are solely determined by the grating equation, which relates periodicity and wavelength to the number and position of the spots (called diffraction orders).

θm = arcsin (sin θi – mλ/d)

In this equation, d is the period, m (integer) is the so-called mode, θm  is the angle at which light will propagate for the m’th mode , and λ is the wavelength. Only the modes where θm is at an angle between -90 to 90 degrees will be visible.

The unique property of having light only in certain orders makes the diffraction grating a key component in many optical systems. Since the angular position of the diffraction spot changes with wavelength (according to the grating equation), a white light source will be split into its spectral components at different angles. This makes gratings a crucial component in devices such as spectrometers or for fine tuning of laser wavelengths.

Photonics Spectra Article: Waveguide Designs Bring Extended Reality into Sight

January 2024 – Photonics Spectra has written an article which discusses the future of alternative, virtual, and mixed reality hinges on waveguide designs that can deliver user comfort, high functionality, and low cost. 

With contributions from NIL Technologies, Lumus, Digilens,VividQ, Inprentus, and in particular, Andreas Georgiou, a Microsoft researcher and optical engineer with Reality Optics in Cambridge, the view is that extended and mixed reality is indeed in sight. 

NIL Technology, which introduced its first diffractive gratings for AR in 2008, is seeing customers continuously request more advanced nanostructures to optimize their display performance. 

“At the same time, customers are, to a constantly higher degree, designing for manufacturing both from a mastering and a replication point of view.”

We make masters for DOEs in silicon and fused silica. We have no fundamental limits to how deep and how many levels we can make.

Masters are used directly in the replication process or to generate sub-masters. In some cases, generations of sub-masters for volume manufacturing by wafer-level replication.

From a DOE master, we can also make nickel shims for use e.g. in an injection molding-based volume manufacturing setup.

Diffractive optical elements and applications

Diffractive optics has the advantage of enhancing the value of laser systems. The technology has many functions and is useful for many types of applications. 

For example, you can find diffractive optics in long-range distance sensors like LiDAR / LADAR (Light Detection And Ranging), short-range distance sensors, position sensors, motion detection, and projection systems.

Beam shaping, beam splitting, diffusers, pattern projections, diffractive focusing lenses, and gratings are just some of the diffractive optics that we are working with. However, it is not just laser systems that benefit from DOEs. Systems based on other light sources can also benefit from diffractive optics even though it is broadband light sources.

You can read more about optical applications here. 

A cross-section of replication in polymer (device) with steep side walls, sharp corners, and low roughness. 

 What are diffractive optical elements anyway?

Diffractive optical elements (DOEs) are optical components made of structures with dimensions comparable to the wavelength in complex arrangements. Based on the types of application, DOEs are capable of manipulating an incident light’s phase and amplitude with the purpose of creating a desired output pattern with a unique functionality.

Diffractive optics with a given function follows the same principles as a diffractive grating with a repetitive pattern of two or more levels, formed on the surface of a substrate – typically etched into the surface of a hard substrate or replicated in a polymer on the surface of a substrate or made purely in polymer. The depth of the pattern is in the order of the wavelength of the light, specific to the application, adjusted to the refractive index of the material of the DOE.
 Benefits of diffractive optics

Nowadays, with the aid of high accuracy advanced micro and nanolithography fabrication techniques, diffractive optics can be engineered with feature sizes ranging from a few hundred nanometers.

Introducing DOEs into classical optical systems can make them smaller and lighter since the diffractive optics are much thinner and lighter optical components compared to their bulky refractive counterparts.

Replacing refractive optical systems with systems based on DOEs, can both add functionality while maintaining high efficiency, drive down the cost and shrink the module size which are all crucial factors for integrated optics.

NIL Technology makes high-quality, custom-made blazed gratings with very low roughness, surface roughness and small anti-blaze. The blazed gratings’ pitch can be down to 150 nm and the blaze angle end grating depth can be tuned to meet the required specifications.

We excel at high precision mastering and we know what it takes to realize high efficiency blazed gratings. Contact us to know more about what we can do in terms of gratings. 

We are specialized in blazed gratings 

NILT is specialized in high-precision nanoscale features and complex optical structures. We have many years experience in making gratings and we have ongoing, close relationships with major high-tech companies that use gratings for research & development, innovative new products and mass production. 

Top- and tilted view of a replication from a NILT blazed grating master. High level of uniformity and accuracy even at the edge of the pattern. The surface roughness is caused by the gold layer needed for SEM imaging. 

Our competencies with blazed gratings include:
 All blazed parameters can be varied according to customer specificationsAnti-blaze can be 90° and both above and below 90°Optical surface qualityOrientation of gratings is not linked to crystal direction. It is possible to freely mix different orientationsExtreme accuracyExcellent uniformity

You are more than welcome to contact us if you would like to know more about blazed gratings and how we can help you. We can be your partner through the whole journey, from idea to design and production of the optical component. Read more about our services right here.

How are blazed gratings used?

Blazed gratings are usually applied within an AR/VR/MR field as incoupling gratings for wave guide displays.

The blaze angle controls which angle the light couples, while the anti-blaze controls the efficiency of the diffraction in that direction. Theoretically, if one achieves a perfect smooth blaze with no anti-blaze, 100% of the incoming light will be diffracted in the desired direction. This of course means that accuracy, uniformity and low surface roughness are of highest importance to realize such gratings – all of which are core competences at NILT.

A blazed grating master with small anti-blaze for high efficiency diffraction

 What are blazed gratings?

Blazed gratings are also called echelette grating (from French échelle = ladder) or saw-tooth gratings. It a special type of reflective or transmission diffraction grating that is optimized to achieve maximum efficiency in one given diffraction order.

For this purpose, maximum optical power is concentrated in the desired diffraction order, while the residual power in the other orders (particularly the zeroth) is minimized. This condition can only be achieved for a single wavelength for each grating. The direction in which maximum efficiency is achieved is called the blaze angle.

The challenge with this type of grating is that a high anti-blaze angle will reduce the efficiency of the desired diffraction order significantly.

Given our expertise within mastering and gratings, NIL Technology are able not only to minimize, but actually tune this anti-blaze angle, and thereby achieve the high efficiency diffraction that is desired.

Optical Applications

We create innovative optical solutions that ensure competitive advantages to optical applications in devices and products. Our key markets are the following:

3D sensing is a key technology in new applications as face recognition, gesture sensing and autonomous vehicles. It is a broad topic including techniques as stereo vision, structured light and time-of-flight. 

NILT specializes in active components for 3D sensing applications. Our core focus are design elements such as DOE or metalenses, DOE diffusers and fan-out gratings for flood and dot projectors, as well DOE or metalenses for receiver optics.

Key areas are Time of Flight  (ToF) and Structured Light (SL)

Many devices in our everyday life require optical sensors, for example mobile phones, displays and wearables. A key requirement for sensors in consumer electronics is high signal to noise ratio, low battery consumption, and compact size.

Thin optics based on diffractive optics or metalenses are ideal for applications in consumer electronics. NILT has long experience with product development for consumer electronics. Flexibility, quick turn-around times, and a Mass Production mind-set, are key attributes to successfully develop and produce optical solutions for consumer electronics products.

We are your partner throughout the whole journey, from idea to design and production of the optical part. We supply design, prototyping and manufacturing services.  

For several years, NIL Technology has delivered masters for augmented and mixed reality (AR/MR) to some of the biggest companies in the industry.

Augmented & mixed reality (AR/MR) refers to interactive experiences of a real-world environment, with overlaid computer-generated information. In more advanced cases, the interactive experiences also interact with the real-world environment.

To create full AR/MR experiences, it is necessary to use a head-mounted display or glasses with integrated and advanced see-through displays that have depth mapping sensors to map the real-world environment.

NILT offers masters and sub-masters for generating see-through displays, made of surface relief waveguides. More, we have optical elements, components, and modules for depth mapping, realized by advanced diffractive optical technologies.  

Automotive, robotics and IoT 

NILT develops innovative optical sensing solutions that ensure competitive advantages to sensors and its performance, size, and weight

The industry of automotive vehicles is highly innovative, and the development of self-driving cars, in-cabin monitoring, and surveillance of car exteriors is accelerating vastly. In automotive vehicles, you find a great number of sensors, automotive sensors that keep track of almost everything that happens inside and outside a vehicle.

Sensors in automotive vehicles, require highly accurate and reliable optics that are both compact and light. The optics, on the other hand, operate with numerous different wavelengths, from visible to near-infrared (NIR) and shortwave infrared (SWIR). Lidars, high precision laser sensors that detect fixed and moving objects, make use of both NIR and SWIR. It is a specific example of advanced optics for automotive vehicles that NILT is specializing on.

Robotics, machine vision and Internet of Things require optics to provide a great number of functions and performance. NILTs dedicated engagement with consumer electronics and automotive makes our optical capabilities and solutions very relevant to these application areas.

Metalenses

Meta Optical Elements (MOE)

Metalenses are a radical new flat lens technology that can disrupt optics used in various industries.

At NILT, we specialize in custom-made metalens solutions, providing end-to-end services from design to mass production.

We develop unique and tailored metalens solutions that cater to the specific needs of our customers, having fast turnaround times for metalens prototyping in the NIR/SWIR/VIS spectra, leading to mass production.  

Metalenses are optimal for various applications as smartphones, AR/VR, wearables, automotive, robotics, and IoT platforms, with applications ranging from depth-sensing and presence detection to face identification, gesture recognition, eye-tracking, driver-monitoring systems, and medical instrumentation.

Metalenses lend themselves to compact lens and module architectures. In near-infrared applications, the lenses are produced using a silicon-on-glass substrate, which makes them mechanically robust and thermally stable.

NILT MOEs are manufactured and assembled using semiconductor-class equipment and deliver consistently high performance in mass production.

Image from a near Infrared imaging system using a single MOE designed for 940 nm wavelength. The demonstrated NILT image has excellent resolution for NIR imaging, all the way to the edge, and is comparable to images captured with a multi-element refractive lens.

Why NILT as your metalens supplier?

At NILT, we have a rich heritage in designing and developing advanced optics. 

We possess a comprehensive in-house process chain knowledge encompassing design, mastering, prototyping, testing, characterization, and manufacturing capabilities for meta optics. 

Our proficiency lies in years of experience in manufacturing micro- and nano-patterned surface relief structures, harnessing nanoimprint lithography (NIL). As a leader in nanostructured mastering and fast prototyping turnaround, we leverage our extensive experience to deliver mass-production metalens solutions, and we are constantly demonstrating record-high metalens results.

Our ability to take customers’ requirements and turn them into optical solutions optimized over the entire process chain differentiates us from others.

NILT MOE produced by nanoimprint lithography

Metalenses are flat lens technology made by optical components that use meta surfaces to manipulate light. They are used in optical applications that take advantage of the flat surface and reduced thickness, compared to classic, curved refractive lenses mainly used in optical devices today.
 How are metalenses used in optical applications?

In optical applications, metalenses can both illuminate (Tx-side) and image (Rx-side) the scene. On the Tx-side, the illumination can be flood-illuminated by diffusers or dot-projected using fan-out optics. On the Rx-side, the imaging lenses deliver similar functionality using fewer lens elements. Current commercial metalenses are focused on narrowband applications such as near-infrared (NIR), short wavelength infrared (SWIR), and narrowband visible, while broadband technology is being developed.
 What is the difference between a refractive lens and a metalens?

In a classical refractive lens, the phase function of the lens is delivered by a continuous curved surface. This refractive lens phase function spans over multiples of the 2p. In a diffractive lens, the lens operates in modulo-2p, where the Nx2p phase values are mapped back to 2p and implemented accordingly. In meta-optics, this modulo-2p phase function is implemented using nanostructures, which are significantly smaller than the wavelength of light. This allows metalenses to deliver functionality like refractive lenses while offering new lens capabilities and trade spaces.

NIL Technology has a whole process chain under one roof for design, mastering, prototyping, testing and characterization, and manufacturing capabilities of meta optics.

NIL Technology has profound and proven experience designing and developing advanced optics by manufacturing micro-and nano-patterned surface relief structures and more than 50 years of experience of cumulative expertise in thermal and UV NIL.

We leverage our extensive experience as a leader in nanostructured mastering and fast prototyping turnaround to deliver mass production metalens solutions.

Illustration of the diffraction of light by a binary line grating and a blazed grating. It is for this particular example assumed that b=Λ /2 and d=λ /(2(n-1)) which gives a phaseshift in the light by ϕ=2π(n-1)d/λ=π. Therefore, light will only be diffracted in odd diffraction orders. 

 Use of custom made diffraction gratings

The shape, pitch and depth of the structures, as well as the wavelength of the light, determine the diffraction properties of the gratings. The parameters can be chosen depending on the application the grating will used for. Our custom made diffraction gratings include both binary line gratings, blazed gratings and slanted gratings.

Binary line gratings are typically used for spectrometerss. Since the diffraction angle is dependent on the wavelength of the incoming light, every wavelength will be diffracted in slightly different directions. This of course demand a high degree of uniformity and symmetry to achieve high efficiency.

Blazed and slanted gratings are commonly applied as incoupling gratings for waveguides used in AR/VR/MR displays.

For these types of gratings, the slant and blaze angle control the diffraction angle while depth and pitch accuracy determines the efficiency. The optical response of the binary grating compared to a blazed grating is illustrated in the figure below. Binary line gratings diffract light in several directions due to the symmetry of the structure, whereas blazed and slanted gratings diffract in a single direction.   

Click on headline to read more our custom diffraction gratings 

What are diffraction gratings?

Diffraction gratings are periodic structures that diffracts light in only a certain number of discrete directions. For example, if you shine laser light through a diffraction grating and onto a wall, you will just see a number of spots on the wall.

The angular location of the spots are solely determined by the grating equation, which relates periodicity and wavelength to the number and position of the spots (called diffraction orders).

θm = arcsin (sin θi – mλ/d)

In this equation, d is the period, m (integer) is the so-called mode, θm  is the angle at which light will propagate for the m’th mode , and λ is the wavelength. Only the modes where θm is at an angle between -90 to 90 degrees will be visible.

The unique property of having light only in certain orders makes the diffraction grating a key component in many optical systems. Since the angular position of the diffraction spot changes with wavelength (according to the grating equation), a white light source will be split into its spectral components at different angles. This makes gratings a crucial component in devices such as spectrometers or for fine tuning of laser wavelengths.

You are more than welcome to contact us if you would like to know more about blazed gratings and how we can help you. We can be your partner through the whole journey, from idea to design and production of the optical component. Read more about our services right here.

How are blazed gratings used?

Blazed gratings are usually applied within an AR/VR/MR field as incoupling gratings for wave guide displays.

The blaze angle controls which angle the light couples, while the anti-blaze controls the efficiency of the diffraction in that direction. Theoretically, if one achieves a perfect smooth blaze with no anti-blaze, 100% of the incoming light will be diffracted in the desired direction. This of course means that accuracy, uniformity and low surface roughness are of highest importance to realize such gratings – all of which are core competences at NILT.

A blazed grating master with small anti-blaze for high efficiency diffraction

 What are blazed gratings?

Blazed gratings are also called echelette grating (from French échelle = ladder) or saw-tooth gratings. It a special type of reflective or transmission diffraction grating that is optimized to achieve maximum efficiency in one given diffraction order.

For this purpose, maximum optical power is concentrated in the desired diffraction order, while the residual power in the other orders (particularly the zeroth) is minimized. This condition can only be achieved for a single wavelength for each grating. The direction in which maximum efficiency is achieved is called the blaze angle.

The challenge with this type of grating is that a high anti-blaze angle will reduce the efficiency of the desired diffraction order significantly.

Given our expertise within mastering and gratings, NIL Technology are able not only to minimize, but actually tune this anti-blaze angle, and thereby achieve the high efficiency diffraction that is desired.

Optical Applications

We create innovative optical solutions that ensure competitive advantages to optical applications in devices and products. Our key markets are the following:

3D sensing is a key technology in new applications as face recognition, gesture sensing and autonomous vehicles. It is a broad topic including techniques as stereo vision, structured light and time-of-flight. 

NILT specializes in active components for 3D sensing applications. Our core focus are design elements such as DOE or metalenses, DOE diffusers and fan-out gratings for flood and dot projectors, as well DOE or metalenses for receiver optics.

Key areas are Time of Flight  (ToF) and Structured Light (SL)

Many devices in our everyday life require optical sensors, for example mobile phones, displays and wearables. A key requirement for sensors in consumer electronics is high signal to noise ratio, low battery consumption, and compact size.

Thin optics based on diffractive optics or metalenses are ideal for applications in consumer electronics. NILT has long experience with product development for consumer electronics. Flexibility, quick turn-around times, and a Mass Production mind-set, are key attributes to successfully develop and produce optical solutions for consumer electronics products.

We are your partner throughout the whole journey, from idea to design and production of the optical part. We supply design, prototyping and manufacturing services.  

For several years, NIL Technology has delivered masters for augmented and mixed reality (AR/MR) to some of the biggest companies in the industry.

Augmented & mixed reality (AR/MR) refers to interactive experiences of a real-world environment, with overlaid computer-generated information. In more advanced cases, the interactive experiences also interact with the real-world environment.

To create full AR/MR experiences, it is necessary to use a head-mounted display or glasses with integrated and advanced see-through displays that have depth mapping sensors to map the real-world environment.

NILT offers masters and sub-masters for generating see-through displays, made of surface relief waveguides. More, we have optical elements, components, and modules for depth mapping, realized by advanced diffractive optical technologies.  

Automotive, robotics and IoT 

NILT develops innovative optical sensing solutions that ensure competitive advantages to sensors and its performance, size, and weight

The industry of automotive vehicles is highly innovative, and the development of self-driving cars, in-cabin monitoring, and surveillance of car exteriors is accelerating vastly. In automotive vehicles, you find a great number of sensors, automotive sensors that keep track of almost everything that happens inside and outside a vehicle.

Sensors in automotive vehicles, require highly accurate and reliable optics that are both compact and light. The optics, on the other hand, operate with numerous different wavelengths, from visible to near-infrared (NIR) and shortwave infrared (SWIR). Lidars, high precision laser sensors that detect fixed and moving objects, make use of both NIR and SWIR. It is a specific example of advanced optics for automotive vehicles that NILT is specializing on.

Robotics, machine vision and Internet of Things require optics to provide a great number of functions and performance. NILTs dedicated engagement with consumer electronics and automotive makes our optical capabilities and solutions very relevant to these application areas.
