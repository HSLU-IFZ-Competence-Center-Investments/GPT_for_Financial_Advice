The Complete Inspection Package for OEMs

Designed to promote efficiency and cost-effectiveness during inspection, our 3DX™ Blade Platform is the ideal choice for OEMs. 

Regular rotor blade inspections form the basis for any professional blade O&M strategy. But how do you increase efficiency without compromising quality? Our integrated inspection system relies on the latest technology to achieve conclusive results in less time than any of the established inspection methods.
A more detailed view of maintenance requirements

The goal is to enable OEMs to issue repair quotes that are based on reliable and detailed data. Automated report generation saves time, and annotations are rated on a scale from cosmetic to serious, so you can optimize resource allocation.

Our 3DX™ Blade Platform facilitates the entire process from planning to damage analysis, significantly cutting the time required for each inspection while simultaneously increasing the quality and repeatability of the results. Not only does this reduce costs, it allows OEMs to solicit accurate repair quotes and work towards predictive maintenance.

The 3DX™ Blade Platform simplifies the way wind asset operators examine and manage their blades. Due to the high degree of automation, rotor blade inspections become highly repeatable, generating an inspection plan that can be used again and again for any given wind park. Inspections are quick to set up, require little manpower and can be run frequently.
Using data to predict inspection needs

The 3DX™ Blade Platform enables you to build a record of checks and damages over the lifespan of your blades. The results obtained from each inspection are added to the database, so you can track progress and analyze trends over the long term.

Extracting Value from Inspection Data to Optimize Wind Farm O&M22.01.2024

Predicting damage to wind turbine rotor blades is notoriously difficult. We know that over the 20 to 30-year lifecycle of a wind farm, some damage will occur, but the when, where, how, or severity is anyone’s guess. And this is why regular inspection is so important. By using autonomous drones to carry out blade inspection, we are building up a treasure of data that can be used over and over again, to show us what is happening over time.3DX™ drone inspection

Historically, inspection reports were not prepared with statistical analysis in mind. The information gathered was for the purpose of recording damages, proving that an activity was done, or to provide a follow up on the asset. But when we talk about blade inspections today, we’re talking about an investment in high-quality, high-resolution images and metadata. Data which records the integrity of the entire blade, including the tiniest damages, and that locates, measures, and classifies them. This marks the start of a new era and as these data are collected on a going forward basis, they also enable quality control of damage repairs and ultimately form the basis for predictive maintenance.

The power of analyticsUnlocking the Future of Wind Turbine Maintenance through Data Analytics

Our 3DX™ Blade Platform marks the start of a digital journey, providing an overview of the status of an entire wind farm fleet. Each successive inspection builds up the data treasure and the more inspections that are carried out using our automated drones, the more valuable the insights. The powerful software allows us to drill down and filter out any given aspect of the data enabling us to analyze specific areas of interest. For example, this could include analysis by damage category or severity class, by region, to identify and compare frequency by type of damages, or by specific wind turbine or blade type to get insights into their performance over time.

Different platform modules let you dive even deeper into the data treasure and let you monitor how damages evolve over time as well as analyze damage patterns in an intuitive way.

Put simply, the 3DX™ Blade Platform with its powerful data analytics module will allow you to turn dormant data into actionable insights.

When we talk about investment in data, we can see the benefits accumulate over the short, medium, and long term. In the short term, the inspection data allows our clients to know in detail the condition of their assets, which enables them to plan and optimize the coming repair campaigns and minimize turbine downtime. Artificial intelligence enables us to accelerate the analysis process.

In the medium term, by analyzing a larger sample of data, we lay the foundation for building a propagation model of blade damages. This enables our customers to better identify and define the most appropriate followup actions as well as prioritize damages requiring rapid attention.

And the more data you have about your blade, the stronger the foundation for blade maintenance decisions. Already today we offer more than just visual blade inspections, such as thermal inspections of the Anti-Icing System and tower inspections. Having all inspection data available in our platform gives a more comprehensive view of your turbine’s condition. In the longer term, it may also be possible to take a deeper look at the blade and combine visual inspections with non-destructive techniques to detect damages inside the composite structures. Soon enough, the industry will be able to incorporate other types of data such as vibration data from the turbines or other sensors installed in the blades, to better monitor the performance of a wind turbine in its entirety.

One thing for certain is that we will find interesting ways to make even better use of the treasure box of data. The wind turbine rotor blade forms part of an ecosystem which touches on operators, OEM’s, insurance companies, investors, asset managers and so forth. All these parties have some interest in the rotor blade conditions and maintenance aspects and cost implications. Providing tools and a platform which enable them to work better together and to create more transparency is a huge benefit on its own.

Sulzer Schmid Introduces New 3DX™ AutoPilot For Industry Leading Image Quality07.11.2023

Zurich, Switzerland, 7 November 2023

Sulzer Schmid, a Swiss company pioneering UAV technology for wind rotor blade inspection, announces the introduction of its latest 3DX™ AutoPilot upgraded with a brand-new image capturing system, to ensure crystal clear inspection results. Mounted on DJI’s latest Matrice M350 Enterprise drone, the new 3DX™ AutoPilot payload provides up to 61MP resolution images and introduces a precise adaptive focus and optimized exposure settings for each image, allowing the drone to be positioned even closer to the blade.SulzerSchmid new AutoPilot

Over recent months, engineers at Sulzer Schmid have been working consistently to improve image quality with the aim to deliver the best image quality on the market. Addressing the challenge of automated camera settings which can sometimes cause blurred images, the new 3DX™ AutoPilot sets a new standard for inspection data. ISO settings, aperture, and shutter speed are individually set for each image to ensure the perfect exposure even when zoomed in. As a result, image quality is superior in terms of sharpness, image density, dynamic range, and exposure accuracy, making it easier to identify and classify damages correctly.New 3DX™ AutoPilot 2023

With the new technology damages are identified with greater precision. The risk of missing a damage or wrongly interpreting inspection data is greatly reduced, thus avoiding any poorly planned or wrongly executed repairs. For example, with the brand-new image capturing system, hairline cracks that are potentially the sign of serious damage, are easier to detect at an early stage, enabling preventive and less costly maintenance to be scheduled.

Tom Sulzer, Sulzer Schmid Co-founder and CEO, stated: “Our commitment to pushing the boundaries of innovation in the wind energy sector is vividly realized in our latest inspection solution. This is not just an upgrade; it’s a revolution in precision and in the way we approach blade inspections— a fast and reliable inspection process, best-in-class image quality and powerful analytics capabilities, all wrapped up in an intuitive digital inspection platform boosted by AI and machine learning.

Founded in 2016 by Sulzer and Schmid, Zurich-based Sulzer Schmid is at the forefront of innovation in the energy service sector. Recognizing the potential for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) technology to redefine industrial grade inspections, the two entrepreneurs have developed an end-to-end technology platform that produces high-quality rotor blade inspection results with ease – precisely, repeatably, efficiently. 

The 3DX™ Blade Platform was deployed for Sulzer Schmid’s first fully autonomous UAV flight in 2018. To date, we have inspected wind turbines in more than 30 countries world wide using our 3DX™ technology and each inspection is underpinned by our commitment to the highest quality, efficiency, safety and groundbreaking use of technology. 

On paper, we are software developers, electronic engineers, entrepreneurs and operations, finance, marketing and sales experts. In reality, we are passionate problem solvers, inventors, makers, testers, code crackers, customer satisfaction managers and more. Our agile approach ensures close collaboration and helps us stay ahead of the curve.

MSc in Mechanical Engineering, ETH Zurich

A graduate of ETH Zurich, Tom got his start developing robotics and advanced control systems for factory automation. In the early ‘90s, a US-based multinational medical tech company came calling, and Tom crossed the pond to pursue an executive career. It wasn’t long before he was running a global division. He first stretched his entrepreneurial wings by launching and running a high-tech startup in Silicon Valley, which he later sold to a US private equity firm.

Upon returning to Switzerland, he founded a private equity boutique that focused on advanced medical technologies.
