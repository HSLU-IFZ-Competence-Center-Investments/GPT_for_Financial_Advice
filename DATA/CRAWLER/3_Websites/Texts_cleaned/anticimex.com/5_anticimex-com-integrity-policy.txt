4. Transferring of personal data outside the company

Anticimex will not sell, disclose or distribute personal data to third parties, except as specified in this Integrity Policy. Within the framework of the service, personal data may be forwarded to an Anticimex supplier, contractor and partner if such is necessary for the performance and supply of the service. Anticimex may also disclose your personal data to other parties such as Anticimex' suppliers for business activities, such as technical support, operations and management of IT systems.

Parties to which Anticimex may transfer personal data may in few cases be located outside the European Economic Area, EEA, which means that personal data may be transferred to countries outside the EEA. If Anticimex transfers personal data to suppliers outside the EEA, through the use of e.g. Microsoft services, we will take steps to ensure that the personal data continues to be protected and we will also take the necessary steps to transfer personal data to countries outside the EEA in a lawful manner.

Processing agreements, as well as confidentiality agreements, are established with all suppliers that process personal data to ensure proper processing.

Furthermore, we may disclose personal data if we are required to do so by law or through a court order or if such disclosure is otherwise necessary to cooperate with a legal investigation. In the event that Anticimex is subject to a merger or sale, we may transfer personal data to the relevant third party provided that the third party undertakes to process the personal data in accordance with this Integrity Policy.
