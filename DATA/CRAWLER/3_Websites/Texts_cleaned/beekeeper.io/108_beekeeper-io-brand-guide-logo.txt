Beekeeper empowers frontline businesses and their workers with the digital solutions they need to do their best possible work. Founded in 2012, Beekeeper’s mobile-first platform was designed and built for deskless employees who — despite representing 80% of the global workforce — have been chronically underserved when it comes to workplace technology. With Beekeeper’s Frontline Success System, companies can automate paper-based processes, communicate with employees in real-time from anywhere, and improve the engagement, productivity, and safety of frontline teams.

The Beekeeper logo is an important expression of our brand identity. The wordmark as well as the hexagon icon have each been carefully designed and constructed to achieve visual harmony, and should never be altered, modified, or redrawn. Because these elements are such recognizable and highly visible brand assets, it is vital that they are always applied consistently.The Beekeeper logo is composed of its hexagon icon and its wordmark. They can be used independently or locked up together.

Ideal clearspace is equal to the logo mark on each side.

The Beekeeper logo should never be used smaller than 20px (height) in digital or 20mm in print. The hexagon icon should never be smaller than 15px (height) in digital or 6mm in print.
