“We recently implemented a digital onboarding process in Pike ToGo [Beekeeper], to reduce paperwork and streamline the orientation process. This saves us about 8,400 pieces of paper each week!”

Melissa StevensHuman Resources Generalist

“To date, we have promoted 107 field leaders, all of whom are highly engaged on Beekeeper. 52% of those same field leaders are still at the company. With the cost to train, hire, and onboard field leaders, that positively impacted our business with $168,000 in savings on increased retention.”

Tamara PalmerInternal Communications Manager

“Beekeeper has allowed us to digitize some of our operational processes like colleague shift management and daily briefings. There are also benefits we didn’t anticipate, such as the popularity of employees sharing personal stories and chiming in to recognize each other’s achievements.”

Mitch AustinCommunications Security Manager

“More than 12,000 non-wired Cargill employees have opted into using this tool and are now easily connected to information, resources, and communication they didn’t have before.”

 Guide

Beekeeper empowers frontline businesses and their workers with the digital solutions they need to do their best possible work. Founded in 2012, Beekeeper’s mobile-first platform was designed and built for deskless employees who — despite representing 80% of the global workforce — have been chronically underserved when it comes to workplace technology. With Beekeeper’s Frontline Success System, companies can automate paper-based processes, communicate with employees in real-time from anywhere, and improve the engagement, productivity, and safety of frontline teams.

The Beekeeper logo is an important expression of our brand identity. The wordmark as well as the hexagon icon have each been carefully designed and constructed to achieve visual harmony, and should never be altered, modified, or redrawn. Because these elements are such recognizable and highly visible brand assets, it is vital that they are always applied consistently.The Beekeeper logo is composed of its hexagon icon and its wordmark. They can be used independently or locked up together.

Ideal clearspace is equal to the logo mark on each side.

The Beekeeper logo should never be used smaller than 20px (height) in digital or 20mm in print. The hexagon icon should never be smaller than 15px (height) in digital or 6mm in print.

Enhance Workplace Safety with Compliant Maintenance Processes

Mobile-first, paperless maintenance and inspection processes built for frontline teams. Digitize maintenance requests for faster repairs.

Maintenance Management Software Designed with Your Frontline Employees in Mind

Paper checklists and forms slow down equipment and asset repair. Decrease downtime for employees, guests, and customers.

How do you reduce the frequency of unplanned maintenance while remaining compliant?

Build a digital maintenance and inspection program for fast, integrated maintenance management.

Catch Breakdowns Before They’re a Problem

Decrease unplanned downtime by discovering equipment issues early. Inspect assets at the beginning of a shift to ensure everything is working and safe. Frontline workers simply fill out a digital form to verify that tools and locations are clean, safe, and ready for work.

If an issue is found during inspection, employees can quickly fill out a digital work order. The maintenance team is automatically assigned a task to review, prioritize, and repair the issue. Submit requests in minutes – no more paper forms that take days to be manually processed.

It took 2-3 days for staff to complete maintenance forms and then eight hours per week to process those paper forms. Now that forms are digitized, we’ve reduced the amount of time it takes to complete and process forms to 3 minutes.

Optimize productivity by scheduling regular preventative maintenance during times that work best for you instead of when you least expect it. Set up a recurring task for your maintenance teams to conduct planned repairs and spend less time and money on maintenance.

Stay Compliant with Comprehensive Records

Automatically organize digital documentation of any inspection forms, checklists, maintenance requests, and scheduled maintenance. Easily navigate to a specific file or task, or analyze your maintenance processes by exporting an overview.

“We recently implemented a digital onboarding process in Pike ToGo [Beekeeper], to reduce paperwork and streamline the orientation process. This saves us about 8,400 pieces of paper each week!”

Melissa StevensHuman Resources Generalist

“To date, we have promoted 107 field leaders, all of whom are highly engaged on Beekeeper. 52% of those same field leaders are still at the company. With the cost to train, hire, and onboard field leaders, that positively impacted our business with $168,000 in savings on increased retention.”

Tamara PalmerInternal Communications Manager

“Beekeeper has allowed us to digitize some of our operational processes like colleague shift management and daily briefings. There are also benefits we didn’t anticipate, such as the popularity of employees sharing personal stories and chiming in to recognize each other’s achievements.”

“Safety is critical at Lakeside. Monthly safety meetings used to happen in person, but now we are developing more materials and utilizing our managers to share that information on Beekeeper. Our commitment to safety does not change with what’s going on—the need to be fast, having less people, get things done—there are no shortcuts.”
Anne Smith, Director of Communications, Lakeside Foods

“Inline translation has been a great tool to communicate with every employee. Our CEO is bilingual so he loves being able to share updates with all team members and know they will be able to receive them in their spoken language. It’s been so wonderful, and frankly, it’s helped us save money so we don’t have to pay a company to translate all communications for us!”
Anne Hanson, Sr. HR Business Partner, Bix Produce

Boost Employee Retention with Better Shift Scheduling 

Mobile-first shift notifications built for frontline teams. Easily accommodate employee requests to offer shift flexibility. 

Increase your ROI with Beekeeper’s Shift Scheduling Tool

Shift planning and coordination software designed with your frontline employees in mind. 

Shift stress is the #1 cause of frontline burnout. Give your teams the relief they need.

How do you reduce shift absenteeism and improve productivity? 

Effective shift communication leads to fewer no shows and better-staffed shifts. Ensure each shift has enough people to do quality work.

Cover Every Shift with Beekeeper’s Shift Scheduling Software 

Share shift schedules in real-time. Your frontline workers will never miss a shift again because they didn’t know when they were expected to be working. 

Need to make changes to a shift? With with the Beekeeper Shift Scheduling Software, employees automatically get a push notification with the update. No more printing out paper schedules that employees have to hunt down. 

Offer More Shift Flexibility 

Handle shift swap requests in minutes instead of hours. Employees find shifts to swap with and submit the request for automatic review with Beekeeper’s Shift Planning Software. 

Have an employee that can’t make their shift at the last minute? Fill last-minute open shifts without making a single phone call and give your frontline workers the flexibility to pick up extra work. 

Before Beekeeper, 1-2 shift managers spent 2 or more days calling and searching for employees to work weekend jobs. Now, Flagger Force managers can get everyone’s availability in just a few clicks to fill every shift.

Shift Handovers Made Simple 

Close the loop on open tasks and resolve issues faster with digitized shift handover notes. No more logbook binders or paper sticky note reminders with Beekeeper’s Shift Scheduling Software.

Extend your Existing Shift Scheduling Solution to the Frontline

“We recently implemented a digital onboarding process in Pike ToGo [Beekeeper], to reduce paperwork and streamline the orientation process. This saves us about 8,400 pieces of paper each week!”

Melissa StevensHuman Resources Generalist

“In the old days, safety audits were paper-based, done manually. Today, we have optimized these processes with Beekeeper in a digital way – workers can enter the information on the spot, then group leaders get an immediate alert if something is unsafe and can then take action focusing on finding solutions to the unsafe situation.”

“To date, we have promoted 107 field leaders, all of whom are highly engaged on Beekeeper. 52% of those same field leaders are still at the company. With the cost to train, hire, and onboard field leaders, that positively impacted our business with $168,000 in savings on increased retention.”

Tamara PalmerInternal Communications Manager

“Beekeeper has allowed us to digitize some of our operational processes like colleague shift management and daily briefings. There are also benefits we didn’t anticipate, such as the popularity of employees sharing personal stories and chiming in to recognize each other’s achievements.”

Mitch AustinCommunications Security Manager

“More than 12,000 non-wired Cargill employees have opted into using this tool and are now easily connected to information, resources, and communication they didn’t have before.”

 b) Add it as a static file to the www.beekeeper.io wordpress page and load it (*this is the preferred solution*) 
 script type="application/javascript" src="www.beekeeper.io/static/js/iframeResizer.min.js"></script
 c) Add it like this as a last resort 

 Later the url will be replaced by the real, prod version: https://pricing.services.beekeeper.io/?main_page_inapp=true&lang=en

“We recently implemented a digital onboarding process in Pike ToGo [Beekeeper], to reduce paperwork and streamline the orientation process. This saves us about 8,400 pieces of paper each week!”

Melissa StevensHuman Resources Generalist

“In the old days, safety audits were paper-based, done manually. Today, we have optimized these processes with Beekeeper in a digital way – workers can enter the information on the spot, then group leaders get an immediate alert if something is unsafe and can then take action focusing on finding solutions to the unsafe situation.”

“To date, we have promoted 107 field leaders, all of whom are highly engaged on Beekeeper. 52% of those same field leaders are still at the company. With the cost to train, hire, and onboard field leaders, that positively impacted our business with $168,000 in savings on increased retention.”

Tamara PalmerInternal Communications Manager

“Beekeeper has allowed us to digitize some of our operational processes like colleague shift management and daily briefings. There are also benefits we didn’t anticipate, such as the popularity of employees sharing personal stories and chiming in to recognize each other’s achievements.”

Mitch AustinCommunications Security Manager

“More than 12,000 non-wired Cargill employees have opted into using this tool and are now easily connected to information, resources, and communication they didn’t have before.”

Beekeeper empowers frontline businesses and their workers with the digital solutions they need to do their best possible work.

The Beekeeper logo is an important expression of our brand identity. The wordmark as well as the hexagon icon have each been carefully designed and constructed to achieve visual harmony, and should never be altered, modified, or redrawn. Because these elements are such recognizable and highly visible brand assets, it is vital that they are always applied consistently.The Beekeeper logo is composed of its hexagon icon and its wordmark. They can be used independently or locked up together.

Ideal clearspace is equal to the logo mark on each side.

The Beekeeper logo should never be used smaller than 20px (height) in digital or 20mm in print. The hexagon icon should never be smaller than 15px (height) in digital or 6mm in print.

 Guide

Beekeeper empowers frontline businesses and their workers with the digital solutions they need to do their best possible work. Founded in 2012, Beekeeper’s mobile-first platform was designed and built for deskless employees who — despite representing 80% of the global workforce — have been chronically underserved when it comes to workplace technology. With Beekeeper’s Frontline Success System, companies can automate paper-based processes, communicate with employees in real-time from anywhere, and improve the engagement, productivity, and safety of frontline teams.

The Beekeeper logo is an important expression of our brand identity. The wordmark as well as the hexagon icon have each been carefully designed and constructed to achieve visual harmony, and should never be altered, modified, or redrawn. Because these elements are such recognizable and highly visible brand assets, it is vital that they are always applied consistently.The Beekeeper logo is composed of its hexagon icon and its wordmark. They can be used independently or locked up together.

Ideal clearspace is equal to the logo mark on each side.

The Beekeeper logo should never be used smaller than 20px (height) in digital or 20mm in print. The hexagon icon should never be smaller than 15px (height) in digital or 6mm in print.

“As smart and clear as the Beekeeper app itself, so was the support and implementation offered by the Beekeeper team. Despite the size of our company with a decentralized structure and around 180 employees, a single half-day workshop with 15 employees was enough to get Beekeeper up and running. Employees love Beekeeper and it’s impossible to imagine lifewithout it.”

“Beekeeper really helped to get everyone at Response engaged and to create a sense of community among all employees. There are so many great things happening and finally, we have a way to share that with everyone.”

“Beekeeper has been the perfect fit. We have 150+ team members working around the clock caring for about 150 aging and disabled residents… Beekeeper is a connected conversation rather than top-down communication. Every team member has the ability to share important information just as much as take it in. Flat out, our team is infinitely more engaged because of Beekeeper.”

Enhance Workplace Safety with Compliant Maintenance Processes

Mobile-first, paperless maintenance and inspection processes built for frontline teams. Digitize maintenance requests for faster repairs.

Maintenance Management Software Designed with Your Frontline Employees in Mind

Paper checklists and forms slow down equipment and asset repair. Decrease downtime for employees, guests, and customers.

How do you reduce the frequency of unplanned maintenance while remaining compliant?

Build a digital maintenance and inspection program for fast, integrated maintenance management.

Catch Breakdowns Before They’re a Problem

Decrease unplanned downtime by discovering equipment issues early. Inspect assets at the beginning of a shift to ensure everything is working and safe. Frontline workers simply fill out a digital form to verify that tools and locations are clean, safe, and ready for work.

If an issue is found during inspection, employees can quickly fill out a digital work order. The maintenance team is automatically assigned a task to review, prioritize, and repair the issue. Submit requests in minutes – no more paper forms that take days to be manually processed.

It took 2-3 days for staff to complete maintenance forms and then eight hours per week to process those paper forms. Now that forms are digitized, we’ve reduced the amount of time it takes to complete and process forms to 3 minutes.

Optimize productivity by scheduling regular preventative maintenance during times that work best for you instead of when you least expect it. Set up a recurring task for your maintenance teams to conduct planned repairs and spend less time and money on maintenance.

Stay Compliant with Comprehensive Records

Automatically organize digital documentation of any inspection forms, checklists, maintenance requests, and scheduled maintenance. Easily navigate to a specific file or task, or analyze your maintenance processes by exporting an overview.

“We recently implemented a digital onboarding process in Pike ToGo [Beekeeper], to reduce paperwork and streamline the orientation process. This saves us about 8,400 pieces of paper each week!”

Melissa StevensHuman Resources Generalist

“To date, we have promoted 107 field leaders, all of whom are highly engaged on Beekeeper. 52% of those same field leaders are still at the company. With the cost to train, hire, and onboard field leaders, that positively impacted our business with $168,000 in savings on increased retention.”

Tamara PalmerInternal Communications Manager

“Beekeeper has allowed us to digitize some of our operational processes like colleague shift management and daily briefings. There are also benefits we didn’t anticipate, such as the popularity of employees sharing personal stories and chiming in to recognize each other’s achievements.”

Mitch AustinCommunications Security Manager

“More than 12,000 non-wired Cargill employees have opted into using this tool and are now easily connected to information, resources, and communication they didn’t have before.”

“We recently implemented a digital onboarding process in Pike ToGo [Beekeeper], to reduce paperwork and streamline the orientation process. This saves us about 8,400 pieces of paper each week!”

Melissa StevensHuman Resources Generalist

“In the old days, safety audits were paper-based, done manually. Today, we have optimized these processes with Beekeeper in a digital way – workers can enter the information on the spot, then group leaders get an immediate alert if something is unsafe and can then take action focusing on finding solutions to the unsafe situation.”

“To date, we have promoted 107 field leaders, all of whom are highly engaged on Beekeeper. 52% of those same field leaders are still at the company. With the cost to train, hire, and onboard field leaders, that positively impacted our business with $168,000 in savings on increased retention.”

Tamara PalmerInternal Communications Manager

“Beekeeper has allowed us to digitize some of our operational processes like colleague shift management and daily briefings. There are also benefits we didn’t anticipate, such as the popularity of employees sharing personal stories and chiming in to recognize each other’s achievements.”

Mitch AustinCommunications Security Manager

“More than 12,000 non-wired Cargill employees have opted into using this tool and are now easily connected to information, resources, and communication they didn’t have before.”

A mobile-first system designed and built for deskless employees

New Hire – Onboarding

Improve new-hire retention by digitizing employee onboarding. Welcome new hires, check off onboarding tasks, share essential documents, and teach SOPs with automatic follow-up and recordkeeping.

Keep employees up-to-date on the latest training they need to gain expertise in their jobs.

Fill positions faster and with higher quality candidates by collecting and managing referrals from current employees.

Fill positions faster and with higher quality candidates by collecting and managing referrals from current employees.

See essential updates and communication at a glance upon opening the app. Quickly access other functions and external platforms.

Deliver communication to your employees in their preferred language. Automatically translate content into 100+ languages.

Improve your workplace environment by understanding how employees feel about their jobs and the organization. Act on feedback to continuously improve.

Forget paper logs and binders to keep track of shift handovers.  Type up shift summaries and create follow-up tasks for the next shift from anywhere.

Solve problems quickly with real-time individual and group messaging. Need to go hands free? Send a voice chat to get the job done

Communicate location closures, weather alerts, and emergencies in a timely manner. Add read receipts to crisis campaigns to check whether employees have seen the information.

A video is worth more than a thousand words. Instead of spending hours crafting detailed written updates, upload a video update in minutes.

Not all information is relevant for all your employees. Share communication specifically for a location, department, or team with the right employees.

Reduce downtime and maintain health and safety compliance with regular maintenance. Regularly main

Reduce accidents and injuries by sharing the health and safety information and policies. Employees can easily self-report safety incidents with automatic follow-up from HR and maintenance. Ensure employees know the latest safety procedures with quizzes.

Get the most out of your tech stack with Beekeeper’s 500+ apps and integrations.

Automate manual HR processes using our no-code workflow builder, designed specifically for the needs of frontline HR teams. Reduce administrative burdens and standardize the employee experience for managers and workers.

“We recently implemented a digital onboarding process in Pike ToGo [Beekeeper], to reduce paperwork and streamline the orientation process. This saves us about 8,400 pieces of paper each week!”

Melissa StevensHuman Resources Generalist

“In the old days, safety audits were paper-based, done manually. Today, we have optimized these processes with Beekeeper in a digital way – workers can enter the information on the spot, then group leaders get an immediate alert if something is unsafe and can then take action focusing on finding solutions to the unsafe situation.”

“To date, we have promoted 107 field leaders, all of whom are highly engaged on Beekeeper. 52% of those same field leaders are still at the company. With the cost to train, hire, and onboard field leaders, that positively impacted our business with $168,000 in savings on increased retention.”

Tamara PalmerInternal Communications Manager

“Beekeeper has allowed us to digitize some of our operational processes like colleague shift management and daily briefings. There are also benefits we didn’t anticipate, such as the popularity of employees sharing personal stories and chiming in to recognize each other’s achievements.”

Mitch AustinCommunications Security Manager

“More than 12,000 non-wired Cargill employees have opted into using this tool and are now easily connected to information, resources, and communication they didn’t have before.”

Customer Success and Support

When we ask our customers what they like the most about Beekeeper, we often get the response “my Customer Success Manager.” This is not a surprise to us, nor does this happen by coincidence. At Beekeeper we have worked hard to build a proactive and highly supportive customer success model.

About the Customer Success Team

While the workplace app we offer is very intuitive and easy to use, the communication challenges our customers face are not so simple. That’s where our talented team comes in to help. As product, content, and technical experts, Customer Success Managers help customers overcome communication challenges and bring out the best in their employees with our internal communications platform. 

In addition to world-class customer relationship management from our Customer Success Managers, we also offer a wealth of resources, including our Help Center and online webinars. We want to make sure you have everything you need to improve communication at your company by providing the best insights and most effective team communication tools.

Phase 1 – Strategy

First we work with you to understand the current status of internal communications at your company. Together we establish goals and draw up a plan for how to achieve them.

Phase 2 – Implementation

Next we transfer knowledge and provide company tools for you to successfully implement Beekeeper. We help remove obstacles and support your team for a smooth roll-out in your workplace.

Phase 3 – Business Impact

Let’s understand the value and impact of Beekeeper on the bottom line, and let the rest of the business know how valuable improved communication and collaboration are.

Phase 4 – Learn & Grow

Kick off from a position of strength! It’s time to capitalize on your success, and build an internal communications strategy for next year and beyond!

 “The support we received in the beginning like PowerPoint templates for the launch was very helpful. Any time I have a question, I send an email and I get either a phone call or a reply back within an hour. Every time. All the customer support has just been really amazing.”
Tommi Krell, Director of Corporate Communications, West Star Aviation

Offer More Shift Flexibility 

Handle shift swap requests in minutes instead of hours. Employees find shifts to swap with and submit the request for automatic review with Beekeeper’s Shift Planning Software. 

Have an employee that can’t make their shift at the last minute? Fill last-minute open shifts without making a single phone call and give your frontline workers the flexibility to pick up extra work. 

Before Beekeeper, 1-2 shift managers spent 2 or more days calling and searching for employees to work weekend jobs. Now, Flagger Force managers can get everyone’s availability in just a few clicks to fill every shift.

Shift Handovers Made Simple 

Close the loop on open tasks and resolve issues faster with digitized shift handover notes. No more logbook binders or paper sticky note reminders with Beekeeper’s Shift Scheduling Software.

Extend your Existing Shift Scheduling Solution to the Frontline 

Put shift information in every employee’s pocket and keep the shift scheduling solution you already use. Whether you build your shift schedules in Excel, UKG Dimensions, or UKG Ready, get more value from the tools and technologies you’ve already invested in.

Find out how much you can save with better Shift Coordination and Coverage

Beekeeper is transforming the way frontline businesses work.

 Beekeeper is on a mission to empower the frontline, believing in the potential of every single employee. This mission is also embedded in our culture: we are committed to helping each other grow, we’re open, we take ownership, and we believe that we’re better together. At Beekeeper, you can expect to learn, to have the flexibility that you need to be successful, to make a difference for our frontline heroes, and to have a lot of fun in the hive with your fellow Bees! 

BEE Stronger Together
By sharing knowledge and mentoring
By succeeding as a team
By showing support, empathy, and kindness
By advocating and celebrating the achievements of others

BEE Open
By challenging our own opinions and assumptions
By being curious about new ideas and alternative solutions
By daring to get outside of our comfort zone and make mistakes
By communicating transparently and compassionately

BEE the Solution
By being the change we want to see

By keeping it simple

By being proactive and persevering through challenges

By being accountable and delivering on what we promise

BEE Frontline First
By adopting a customer-focused view for everything we do

By asking questions and listening carefully to understand our customers

By building products and solutions that solve our customers’ pains

By building trusting relationships where we challenge, inspire, and enable the frontline

At Beekeeper, we Celebrate Diversity!

Diversity and Inclusion are fundamental pillars of Beekeeper’s culture. With 29 nationalities across 4 countries, we are a small but truly international team. We believe this is a key contributor to why our employee survey shows that people of all cultures and backgrounds are respected and valued here. 

Our Diversity & Inclusion Working Group loves to find every opportunity to celebrate the diversity of our teams – for example, we come together to share our stories during Diversity Week, Pride Month, Hispanic Heritage Month and Mental Health Awareness week. We learn from each other during these events, which strengthens our empathy and gets us closer to our goal of an inclusive environment where everyone can bring their whole self to work. 

In our commitment to equal opportunities and building a diverse community at Beekeeper, all candidates will be considered for employment regardless of race, colour, ancestry, religion, nationality, sexual orientation, age, citizenship, marital status, disability or gender identity.

And these are not just words to convince you to join us; we live our values and show up for each other every day. 

 Watch this short video where some of our LGBTQ+ colleagues share their experiences at Beekeeper and tips on how to make the workplace even more welcoming.

Customer Success and Support

When we ask our customers what they like the most about Beekeeper, we often get the response “my Customer Success Manager.” This is not a surprise to us, nor does this happen by coincidence. At Beekeeper we have worked hard to build a proactive and highly supportive customer success model.

About the Customer Success Team

While the workplace app we offer is very intuitive and easy to use, the communication challenges our customers face are not so simple. That’s where our talented team comes in to help. As product, content, and technical experts, Customer Success Managers help customers overcome communication challenges and bring out the best in their employees with our internal communications platform. 

In addition to world-class customer relationship management from our Customer Success Managers, we also offer a wealth of resources, including our Help Center and online webinars. We want to make sure you have everything you need to improve communication at your company by providing the best insights and most effective team communication tools.

Phase 1 – Strategy

First we work with you to understand the current status of internal communications at your company. Together we establish goals and draw up a plan for how to achieve them.

Phase 2 – Implementation

Next we transfer knowledge and provide company tools for you to successfully implement Beekeeper. We help remove obstacles and support your team for a smooth roll-out in your workplace.

Phase 3 – Business Impact

Let’s understand the value and impact of Beekeeper on the bottom line, and let the rest of the business know how valuable improved communication and collaboration are.

Phase 4 – Learn & Grow

Kick off from a position of strength! It’s time to capitalize on your success, and build an internal communications strategy for next year and beyond!

 “The support we received in the beginning like PowerPoint templates for the launch was very helpful. Any time I have a question, I send an email and I get either a phone call or a reply back within an hour. Every time. All the customer support has just been really amazing.”
Tommi Krell, Director of Corporate Communications, West Star Aviation
