Clean Cookstove Projects: Debunking Headlines and Embracing Progress

Amidst the flurry of media attention surrounding clean cookstove projects, it is essential to consider a full range of standpoints to ensure that we focus on continuously improving the quality and integrity of carbon projects. Scrutiny drives change, and with it, the voluntary carbon market can continue to deliver climate finance to initiatives that go beyond emission reductions and offer meaningful benefits to communities. 	

Why is Article 6 so relevant to the VCM from a quality and integrity perspective?

Waves are being made in the Voluntary Carbon Market (VCM) by the publication of a study calling for the retraction of the West et al. study used in an article by the Guardian earlier in the year to claim that "more than 90% of rainforest carbon offsets are worthless".	

COP28: voluntary carbon highlights

COP28 has been a whirlwind of activity and it feels like this is finally the time that Voluntary Carbon Markets can move on from recent troubles and find new purpose and growth.
