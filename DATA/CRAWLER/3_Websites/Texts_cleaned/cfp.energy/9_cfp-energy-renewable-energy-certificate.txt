Renewable energy certificates

From challenge to credibility

From water to wind, renewable energy sources are variable by nature. When conditions are right, generated energy is fed into the power grid — but how can this be accurately tracked? With many organisations on the path to reduced climate impact via renewable energy adoption, it’s increasingly important to get a strategy in place.

Renewable energy certificates provide a solution – proving that a certain measure of electricity has been generated from renewable sources. And because they carry a precise economic and environmental value, certificates can also be traded. This turns the production of renewable energy into a marketable asset – unlocking a host of options and incentives for the businesses that are ready to benefit.

Secure bespoke solutions that best respond to your company’s energy consumption, location and environmental ambitions, as we combine strategic intelligence and insight into market dynamics to navigate verification, pricing trends and certificate availability.

Show clear commitment. Avoiding vague or exaggerated claims about use, and taking care to purchase legitimate renewable energy certificates.

Judge timings. Fluctuations in supply and demand make knowing when to enter and exit the market critically important.
