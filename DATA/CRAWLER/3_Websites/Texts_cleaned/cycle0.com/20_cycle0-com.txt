Turning waste into renewable natural gas

We’re an end-to-end biomethane provider delivering innovative solutions that are slowing the pace of global warming - today.

Powering the global shift to clean and scalable energy for all

Methane gas is a super pollutant that has more than 80 times the warming power of carbon dioxide over the first 20 years after it reaches the atmosphere. We build, own and operate plants that turn these harmful emissions into the renewable natural gas that’s helping to slow climate change today.

Turning methane from a harmful greenhouse gas into renewable energy with small-scale, decentralised biomethane plants
Agricultural waste is the biggest human-caused source of methane on the planet, accounting for nearly one-third of these GHG emissions. We partner with agri-food producers to build biomethane facilities that convert waste into renewable natural gas and help grow the circular economy.

Our decentralized facilities benefit agri-food producers and help to unlock the value of stranded feedstock.

We use proprietary technology to capture and convert distributed sources of biogas to produce Bio-CNG and Bio-LNG, with no direct pipeline connection necessarily needed.

Through our subsidiary, FNX, we build skid-mounted upgrading and liquefaction units for ease of installation.

How is biomethane used?

Get your guide from agri-food waste to biomethane

Decentralised and scalable biomethane projects are critical to achieving European decarbonisation goals. In this guide, you will learn more about our modular, small to medium-scale upgrading and liquefaction technology, which is manufactured and tested in-house at our manufacturing facilities located in the Spanish Basque country.

Our impact
Developing small-scale, decentralised biomethane projects is an essential part to achieving RePowerEU's goal of 35 bcm of biomethane production by 2030. Over the lifetime of our projects, we are reducing Greenhouse Gas Emissions as follows:

0

Yearly tonnes of CO2 reduced, equivalent to the absorption capacity of a forest which would fit into ~300,000 football pitches 

0

MWh equivalent of renewable energy produced, equivalent to the power consumed by ~423,678 EU Citizens in one year

0

Tons of agri-food waste processing capacity over the lifetime of our projects

Proven technology and expertise
As an integrated biomethane supplier, we build, own and operate biomethane plants in Europe and beyond. Manufactured by our subsidiary, FNX, our modular plant designs are fully tested in-house; making for easy deployment at any production site.

Our technology is proven and already operating in Spain and Italy—today.
