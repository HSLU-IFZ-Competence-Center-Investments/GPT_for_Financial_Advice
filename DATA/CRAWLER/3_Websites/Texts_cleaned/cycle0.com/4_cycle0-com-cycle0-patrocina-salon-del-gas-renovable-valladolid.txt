CycleØ Sponsors the III Renewable Gas Trade Fair, Spain’s Biggest Renewable Gas Conference

With its significant areas of farmland, Spain has the potential to produce up to 163 bcm of biomethane annually by 2050. The key to realizing that potential is utilising technology to capture agri-food waste from rural areas, and building plants effectively and efficiently. 

It is essential to quickly accelerate the deployment of biomethane plants in the country. This is exactly the focus of the III Renewable Gas Trade Fair, as well as the 16th International Bioenergy Congress that will run in parallel.

On October 3rd and 4th, we will be participating in this important event in the renewable gases sector in Spain, which will take place at the Feria de Valladolid exhibition center. 

Our CycleØ and FNX teams will be pleased to welcome you at booth 314, where you will be able to learn about the projects we develop, own and operate, as well as our small to medium-scale upgrading and liquefaction technology.

On Tuesday, October 3 at 12:30 pm, Our CEO, Laurence Molke, will participate in a round table within the 16th International Bioenergy Congress that will address the keys to accelerate the startup and deployment of plants; including the support, resources, technology and financing required.

We look forward to seeing you in Valladolid! If you haven’t registered, you can still do so:
