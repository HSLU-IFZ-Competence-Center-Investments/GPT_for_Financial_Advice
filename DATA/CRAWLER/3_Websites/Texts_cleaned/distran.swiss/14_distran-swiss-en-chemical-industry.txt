Acoustic Leak Imaging for the Chemical Industry

More uptime with less effort

From a gas leak detection point of view, chemical as well as pharmaceutical production and processing sites are challenging settings. They are vast production facilities comprising complex components and piping systems. They include numerous process gases and cause potentially harmful emissions.

As for all production facilities, uptime and safety are crucial for chemical plants. With the Distran ultrasonic cameras, operators detect vacuum leaks and leaks of all gas types up to 10x faster and from safe distances. Our ATEX-certified (intrinsically safe) acoustic camera can be employed safely in hazardous areas.

Both the plants’ own maintenance teams and service providers have our devices in use. They use Distran cameras during commissioning, planned and unexpected shutdowns, or regular inspections to pinpoint numerous kinds of leaks: vacuum, compressed air, steam, hydrogen, methane, nitrogen, acetylene, ammonia, and many others.

Bridging leak detection with maintenance, the integrated reporting tool Audalytics allows for creating reports and planning repairs based on quantified leak rates along with recorded videos, images, etc.

6 advantages for the Chemical Industry by using Distran ultrasonic cameras

Why do chemical plants detect gas and vacuum leaks with Distran?

Why do chemical plants detect gas and vacuum leaks with Distran?

Distran ultrasonic cameras do not require contact with the gas. They allow for detecting leaks from 0.3 100 m (1 – 330 ft), making climbing aids unnecessary.

Compared to other approaches such as soap spray or sniffers, our devices detect vacuum and gas leaks up to 10x faster, improving product quality.

After a 15-minute introduction, new users are ready to start detecting gas leaks with our single-handed, intuitive acoustic cameras.

Combining the built-in reporting tool with the leak rate quantification feature, priorities can be set for repairs based on various data.

Detecting vacuum and gas leaks more quickly and safely, our single-handed acoustic cameras help keep plants running and make production more reliable.

The Ultra Pro X is an ATEX-certified (intrinsically safe) leak detection camera for use in potentially explosive areas.

Ensure chemical and pharmaceutical production performance and worker’s safety with Distran Ultra Pro X ultrasonic camera.

Detection of leaks of hazardous gases in hard-to-reach areas

A proven preventative maintenance tool

Previously, leak detection activities required a lot of energy consumption, human resources, scaffolding, time, and ultimately costs. For instance, to search a tank for leaks by soaping it up, could take weeks. For reasons often related to safety regulations, it was much more difficult to check for leaks during normal operations.

Different from traditional leak detection technologies such as soap spray and sniffers, Distran’s approach is based on Acoustic Leak Imaging. Detecting the specific sounds vacuum and gas leaks generate, our devices allow for searching for leaks from safe distances and regardless of the type of gas.

Chemical plants benefit from this new approach, as they can reduce the material, staff, time, and ultimately costs of inspections. Even if they check for small leaks of toxic or explosive gases, it is much easier to align safety concerns with reliability goals.

Therefore, the ATEX-certified Distran ultrasonic camera has proven to be especially effective for the detection of hazardous gases such as hydrogen and acetylene.
