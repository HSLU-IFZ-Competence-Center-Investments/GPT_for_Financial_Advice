Distran Ultrasonic Cameras for gas leak detection – safe, fast, reliable

Detect gas leaks to protect your plant on land, sea, and in space

Inspection specialists in Oil & Gas, Power Generation, Chemistry, Composite Engineering, and other fields detect gas leaks with our ultrasonic cameras to protect people, improve plant reliability, and increase performance.

Leveraging Acoustic Leak Imaging (ALI), Distran Ultra Pro, Distran Ultra Pro X, and Distran Ultra CE are acoustic imaging cameras that pinpoint gas leaks from far distances, without contact with the gas, and in unexpected locations. Inspection times are up to 10 times shorter than with other techniques.

Ultrasonic imaging cameras detect leaks of any gas: hydrogen, compressed air, methane, nitrogen, steam, vacuum leaks, and more. Based on the combination of an integrated microphone array with an optical camera, the easy-to-use Distran Ultrasonic Cameras capture ultrasound and show the accurate locations of the leaks.

Advantages of our acoustic imaging cameras

6 reasons to detect gas leaks with Distran

START USING WITHOUT EXPERT KNOW-HOW

Distran’s acoustic cameras are intuitive, easy-to-use devices. Anyone can use the only 1.5 kg (3.3 lb) heavy, one hand-held acoustic cameras displaying the exact locations of gas leaks and all the relevant data even in noisy areas.

DETECT GAS LEAKS 10X FASTER

By finding leaks from safe distances Distran’s gas leak detection cameras reduce the need for scaffolding. Inspection times are up to 10x shorter than with traditional methods that require contact with the gas or expert know-how.

DETECT LEAKS OF ANY TYPE OF GAS

As they detect ultrasounds generated by the pressure difference between the pressurized system and the outside environment, Distran Ultrasonic Cameras pinpoint leaks of all types of gas. A pressure difference of 50mbar is sufficient.

QUANTIFY THE LEAK RATE IN REAL-TIME

Distran Ultrasonic Cameras quantify and display the leak rate in real-time, i.e. the size of detected leaks. Inspection specialists harness this feature to evaluate the costs of leaks and hence to prioritize maintenance activities.

AVOID CONTACT WITH THE GAS

Acoustic gas detection makes contact with the gas obsolete. Improving the safety of staff, Distran Ultra Pro, Distran Ultra Pro X, and Distran Ultra CE enable staff to detect gas leaks from a safe distance of up to 100 m (300 ft).

INSPECT WITH AN ATEX-CERTIFIED DEVICE

Announced in January 2021 and specifically designed for the use within potentially explosive areas, Distran Ultra Pro X is the intrinsically safe (ATEX-certified) version of Distran Ultra Pro to detect gas leaks fast, safely, and reliably.

Bringing innovation to meet the challenges of climate change

Reduce fugitive emissions with Distran Ultrasonic Cameras

Since its foundation in 2013, Distran has been committing to support companies in taking action for the climate. With customers in sectors such as Oil & Gas, the Chemical Industry, Power Generation, and Composite Manufacturing, we aim to empower them not only to detect gas leaks, but also to reduce fugitive emissions and hence their ecological footprint.

By 2026, Distran’s acoustic imaging solutions will have saved more than 100 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (MMtCO2e). This amount is equivalent to 21.750.000 passenger vehicles driven for one year.

We are proudly supported by the Swiss Climate Foundation and the Bundesamt für Umwelt (Swiss federal office for the environment).

Let’s act now and rise up to the challenge!
