Prepare your Oil and Gas production plant for the upcoming European Union regulation on methane emissions

Discover the potential effects these regulations can have on your everyday operations, and explore the different technologies to fulfill the mandatory LDAR program requirements.

Considering the significant environmental impact of methane fugitive emissions, Leak Detection and Repair (LDAR) programs emerge as a fundamental approach to counteract climate change.

The European Union acknowledges the critical role of LDAR and proposes a regulation mandating the implementation of such programs by Oil and Gas operators. The proposed regulations encompass two distinct inspection levels with specific detection thresholds and inspection frequencies.

Various technologies are available to meet the requirements outlined in this regulatory proposal, including Acoustic Leak Imaging (ALI) cameras, Optical Gas Imaging (OGI) cameras, and Flame Ionization Detectors (FID).
This whitepaper compares the different features of the technologies and how they comply with the planned new regulation. You will learn more about:

LDAR as a key strategy to help reduce methane emissions
Different technologies to detect methane leaks
A comparative study of gas leak detection technologies regarding

Inspection time
Detected leaks & measured emissions
Compliance of the technologies with the new EU regulation
