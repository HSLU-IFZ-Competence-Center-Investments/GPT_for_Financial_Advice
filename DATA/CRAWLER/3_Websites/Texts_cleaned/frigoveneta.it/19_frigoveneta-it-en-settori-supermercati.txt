You can be sure, it’s Frigoveneta

We’ve developed a range of compact, quiet and efficient machines for the large retail field.

With the entry into force of European Regulation 517/2014, the range has been enriched by the new CO2 machines.

The wide range of machines satisfies every requirement both for refrigeration and heating/cooling of the retail stores.

The system’s design is aimed at production and maintenance simplicity, as well as effective management. This all translates into reliability and functioning efficiency.

In addition to theTelegest system, the latestFrigoveneta creations for the large retail sector are the Unigest system (integrated management for energy-intensive users) and the Unicalor system (heat condensation recovery).

The achievable energy savings are certain and measurable.
