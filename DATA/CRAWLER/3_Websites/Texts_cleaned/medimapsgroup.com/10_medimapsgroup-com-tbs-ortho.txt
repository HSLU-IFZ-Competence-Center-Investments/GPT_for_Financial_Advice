Bone quality assessment for surgical implants and procedures 

 is a medical imaging software technology, which will give orthopedic surgeons critical information on a patient’s trabecular bone microarchitecture. This will help them select the most appropriate procedures and implants and ensure optimal implant stability and outcome for hips, shoulders, spine or knee replacement surgery.

Since orthopaedic implants are fixed in the trabecular bone area, the quality of the bone itself matters. If it is fragile, implants can become loose, unstable or migrate, causing pain and reducing a patient’s mobility. A revision joint replacement surgery, a longer, more complicated procedure than the initial one, may have to be performed early on.

With the critical information provided by TBS, orthopaedic surgeons will be able to choose appropriate implants and procedures according to their patient’s bone quality. TBS Ortho may help reduce the number of revisions of joint replacements due to fragile bones; better predict implant failure; improve recovery time; save consultation and surgery time; justify incurred costs to the payers (insurances); justify procedures used in case of litigation.

How TBS Ortho can help

With the critical information provided by TBS, orthopaedic surgeons will be able to choose appropriate implants and procedures according to their patient’s bone quality. TBS Ortho may help reduce the number of revisions of joint replacements due to fragile bones; better predict implant failure; improve recovery time; save consultation and surgery time; justify incurred costs to the payers (insurances); justify procedures used in case of litigation.

Based on the analysis of regular 2D X-ray images, Cone Beam CT scans or regular CT scans, the TBS algorithm computes a specific score to assess the trabecular bone quality, which is related to its 3D-microarchitecture. Results are obtained with no additional patient radiation exposure nor scan time.
