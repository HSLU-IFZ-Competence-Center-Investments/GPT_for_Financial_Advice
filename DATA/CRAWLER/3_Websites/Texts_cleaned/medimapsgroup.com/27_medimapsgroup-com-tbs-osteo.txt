The gold standard for osteoporosis fracture risk assessment 

Providing the full bone health picture

Osteoporosis is a common disease characterised by low bone density and microarchitectural deterioration of bone tissue. Its consequences are an increase in bone fragility leading to an increased risk for fractures, especially of the hip, spine and wrist.

Moreover, while the measurement of Bone Mineral Density (BMD) is important in the diagnosis of osteoporosis, it has its own limitations. BMD alone cannot identify all patients who are at high risk of bone fracture. In fact, the Bone microarchitecture information is needed in order to provide a complete diagnostic.

TBS iNsight™ is the missing link to bone fracture risk prediction

TBS iNsight™ is Medimaps Group flagship software. This advanced imaging software application for bone densitometers (DXA) computes a Trabecular Bone Score (TBS), which provides extremely useful additional clinical information as to the microarchitecture of the bone. TBS iNsight™ helps capture an additional ~30% of patients at fracture risk*. Since January 2022 TBS is reimbursed in the USA.

*Adapted from Table 3 in Hans et al. J Bone Miner Res: 2011 Nov;26 (11):2762-9

Two patients with the same bone density (same BMD values) can have a different underlying bone microarchitecture (different TBS scores). They will not have the same fracture risk.

The combination of Trabecular Bone Score, BMD and clinical risk factors or FRAX provides a more comprehensive overview of a patient’s bone health. It improves fracture risk prediction, helps identify more patients at risk and fine-tune therapy decision.*

*Based on monitoring of changes of TBS across time.

How TBS Osteo can help

Medimaps developedto assess the microarchitectural deterioration of bone tissue – the second main characteristic of osteoporosis. It computes a Trabecular Bone Score (TBS), which provides extremely useful additional clinical information as to the microarchitecture of the bone.

How does TBS iNsight™ work?

Easily installed on a DXA machine, TBS iNsight™ uses the DXA 2-D images produced during a regular spine BMD scan to seamlessly computes a patient’s Trabecular Bone Score. This result is displayed in an automated report that can be edited and is easy to interpret by practitioners and requires no additional patient scan time and no additional radiation.

BOOK A DEMO 
Medicare reimbursement for TBS

Medicare reimbursement is currently possible for TBS iNsight™ (Osteo) for DXA. Trabecular Bone Score (TBS) procedures benefit from four dedicated Category 1 CPT® codes and can be paid through the Physician Fee Schedule (PFS) and the Hospital Outpatient Prospective Payment System (OPPS).
