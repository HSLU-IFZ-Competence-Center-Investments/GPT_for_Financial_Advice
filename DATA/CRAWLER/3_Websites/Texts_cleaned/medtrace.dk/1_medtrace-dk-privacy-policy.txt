D. ConsentYou can withdraw your consent to MedTrace’s processing of your personal data at any time. You can withdraw your consent by contacting us using the contact information provided above (section A).

The lawfulness of the processing and transfer based on your consent before your withdrawal is not affected if you choose to withdraw your consent. If you choose to withdraw your consent it will thus first have effect from this point of time.

E. SourcesThe personal data we process on you is primarily provided directly from you or from your unit. In some cases, the information is provided from your employer or from public authorities such as tax authorities.

F. Provision and failure to provideIn most circumstances when we collect personal data directly from you, you provide us with the information voluntarily or in order to enter into or to fulfill the requirements of a contract with us. In some circumstances, you are obligated to provide the information to us, e.g. your personal identity/social security-number for reporting to the tax authorities.

The consequence of not providing the personal data, as listed above, is that we cannot address the purposes mentioned above. Thus, we cannot make the website available to you, we cannot communicate with you, we cannot comply with our obligations as your contracting party and cannot comply with our obligations towards public authorities.

G. Data ProcessorsMedTrace uses Data Processors to host personal data and to support our use of systems.

In relation to clinical trial subjects, MedTrace uses a Data Processor, Cardiovascular Clinical Studies located in Boston, USA, to manage the clinical trials (a “Contract Research Organizations” or “CRO”). The CRO will in many cases also use processors (e.g. “Principal Investigators”).

H. Transfer of personal dataIn some cases, MedTrace transfers personal data to Data processors, to the MedTrace website, to public authorities or to external legal advisors and accountants.

I. Transfer to third countries

In some situations, MedTrace transfers personal data to countries outside of the EU/EEA countries, currently to the US. We transfer information to the US, because MedTrace has a US based department of MedTrace, MedTrace Pharma, Inc (US). In relation to clinical trials, MedTrace will transfer personal data to and from the US as the trials will take place in the US.

The Commission of the European Union has not made a decision on the legality of the practice on data protection in the US or the EU-US Privacy Shield. In most cases, transfers will be based on your consent, based on the necessity for the performance of a contract between you and MedTrace or based on the necessity for the performance of a contract in your interest between MedTrace and another natural or legal person, cf. art. 49 (1) (a), (b) and (c) GDPR.
