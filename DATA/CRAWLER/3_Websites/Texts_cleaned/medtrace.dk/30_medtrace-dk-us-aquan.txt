Automated software for 15O-water PET myocardial blood flow analysis. 

aQuant is a software suite for the automated and robust analysis of 15O-water. The underlying algorithms of aQuanthave been used in more than 30 peer-reviewed studies over the last decade. aQuant is currently not approved bythe FDA, and is not CE-marked. 

Each 15O-water scan is segmented using Cluster Analysis, automatically extracting the blood input function. 

	By automatic generation, reorientation and segmentation of quantitative parametric images of blood flow, results
are ready for review with hardly any user interaction necessary.	

Results of MBF at stress and rest as well as Coronary Flow Reserve are presented as short and long axis images, polarmaps and in tabular form. Color coding helps the reader identify abnormal segments and defect size. Perfusable Tissue Index (PTI), a fibrosis index unique to 15O-water, is presented in a similar fashion. Build-in quality control helps the reviewer assess the quality of the scan. 

Results are summarized on a report page and can be exported to local PACS system as a DICOM image. Parametric images can likewise be exported as DICOM images for documentation or subsequent fusion with CT angiogram.

Historically, the analysis of 15O-water was challenging due to high noise levels and low contrast. The introduction of PET/CT has greatly improved image quality, enabling a routine use of 15O-water. However, the low contrast remains, complicating analysis. Analyzing 15O-water therefore requires a different approach than normal: we first need to generate contrast. 

These input functions are then further used to generate diagnostic images using 15O-water’s simple kinetic model. The high-contrast images of Perfusable Tissue Fraction (PTF) are then used for automated segmentation of the heart itself. Since PTF does not represent blood flow, this eliminates observer bias in low-blood flow regions.
