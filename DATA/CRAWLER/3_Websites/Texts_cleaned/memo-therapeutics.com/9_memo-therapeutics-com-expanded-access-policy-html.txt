ExpandedAccess Policy - Memo Therapeutics AG

[if lt IE 9]><script src="assets/html5shiv/js/html5shiv-printshiv.min.js"></script><![endif]

Memo Therapeutics AG (“MTx”) is committed to developing promising new therapies to address the unmet medical needs of patients suffering from rare and seriously debilitating diseases.

We currently have late-stage investigational medicines in our product pipeline for the treatment of BK viremia in kidney transplant recipients. Our goal is to provide access to our medicines at the appropriate time and in a manner that is most beneficial to the relevant patient population. We believe enrollment in our ongoing clinical trials is the safest and most effective way of achieving this goal.

We do recognize that some patients will not be eligible for our clinical trials and may wish to access our products through expanded access. However, at this time, we do not have the resources available to offer expanded access use of our investigational medicines.

We encourage all patients and physicians who are interested in accessing our investigational medicines to visit the clinical trial section of our website to find out about enrolling (https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT05769582?cond=BKV&draw=3&rank=16).

MTx may revise this expanded access policy at any time. Additionally, the posting of this policy by MTx does not serve as a guarantee of access to any specific investigational new drug by any individual patient.

If you have any questions, please reach out to us at info@memo-therapeutics.com. You can find further contact details on the Contact page of our website (https://memo-therapeutics.com/contact.html).

We may change this policy at any time.  Please check back periodically for updates on EAP clinical trials.
