INTRODUCING THE FIRST ORGANISM-ON-CHIP TECHNOLOGY

ENABLING 3rs FULL-ORGANISM TESTING

Automated end-to-end culture, treatment, imaging and analysis

 combines the unique Organism-on-Chip technology with robotics and high-content imaging to make all the C. elegans experimentation processes automated.

Thanks to the development of our patented Microfluidic Worm Matrices (MWM) technology, we offer the possibility of confining worms within large arrays of microfluidic chambers in a simple, fast and reproducible way, by means of passive hydrodynamic worm-valves.

By the usage of our MWM method, the Nagi team was eble to develop a myth that today is a reality: the first Organism-on-Chip technology for the controlled growth of C. elegans and their automated time-resolved treatment and analysis, throughout their entire lifespan.

From a chip to a full system

Thanks to the scalability and ease of use of the Nagi chips, today we present the full end-to-end solution for high-content screening of substances on micro-organisms: SydLab™ One.

SydLab™ One

Inside the nagi chips

discover the secrets of the first organism-on-chip

No more messy plates. No more manual handling. Unlock the full potential of small organisms with the microfluidic Nagi™ Chips. More parallel conditions, more readouts, more possibilities. All compatible with the SydLab™ One products.

Explore all the Nagi™ Chips

Sydlab™ One: One device. infinite possibilities.

Get whole-organism readouts like never before

SydLab™ One can run tests on up to four Nagi™ Chips in parallel, where 1000+ individual micro-organisms are automatically confined, cultured, treated, and studied via time-lapse microscopy images and videos at unprecedented throughput and over long-term time-resolved experiments.

Combining cutting-edge high-content screening technology and robotics, SydLab™ One is the first all-in-one benchtop laboratory device capable of performing multiple bioassays and wide screenings of your compounds of interest on micro-organisms.
