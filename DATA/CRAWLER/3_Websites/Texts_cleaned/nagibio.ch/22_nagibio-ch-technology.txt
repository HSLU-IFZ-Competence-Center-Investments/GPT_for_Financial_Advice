Technology

unlocking powerful readouts at unprecedented scalability and reproducibility

Full organism data made ethical

By standardizing the current manual protocols of small organisms experimentation, our technology achieves unimaginable readouts up-to-date.

1 week, 1 experiment, 64 conditions

Design your experiments seamlessly, from 1 week  up to the full lifespan of the organisms (in C. elegans is ≈4 weeks). 

POWERFUL SOLUTIONS FOR POWERFUL RESEARCH. EXPLORE YOUR DATAPOINTS SEAMLESSLY

DISCOVER THE INS-AND-OUTS OF THE FIRST HIGH-CONTENT SCREENING technology OBTAINING FULL-ORGANISM READOUTS.

The technology behind the first Organism-on-Chip explained in-depth.

Discover the journey until the creation of the first all-in-one high-content screening laboratory system of drugs and chemicals operating on a full organism while being part of the alternative testing methodologies toolkit.

All the biological models compatible with Nagi’s systems and technologies.

Meet the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, a microscopy roundworm with a powerful conserved genetic toolkit and 60+ years of validated research behind. An excellent ethical alternative to vertebrate models.
