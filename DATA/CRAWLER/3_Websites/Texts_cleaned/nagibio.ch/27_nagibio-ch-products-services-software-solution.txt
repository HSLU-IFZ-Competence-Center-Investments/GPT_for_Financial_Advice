Failure in later stages of the R&D pipeline is especially costly. We actively pursue technologies to identify adverse toxicology as early as possible, such as Nagi Bioscience’s technologies.

Unfavorable toxicological profiles are a major cause of late failure in our discovery pipelines. Failure in later stages of the R&D pipeline is especially costly. We are actively pursuing technologies to identify adverse toxicology as early as possible, including through the use of model systems such as those being investigated by Nagi Bioscience.

Methodologies to assess lifespan and healthspan measures in a high-throughput manner are currently inadequate in the C. elegans field. The integration of Nagi’s technology opened many possibilities for us as a company.

Before proceeding to clinical trials, the efficacy of our existing drugs or combinations thereof for their positive impact on healthspan will be tested in the nematode C.elegans. However, methodologies to assess lifespan and healthspan measures in a high-throughput manner are currently inadequate in the C. elegans field. The integration of Nagi’s technology into Rejuvenate opened many possibilities for us as a company.
