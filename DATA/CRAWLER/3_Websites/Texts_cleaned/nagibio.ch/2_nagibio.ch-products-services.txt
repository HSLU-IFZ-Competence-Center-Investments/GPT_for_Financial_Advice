Nagi™ Assay kits

Unpack the potential of the first Organism-on-Chip

Get your SydLab™ experiments started with our Nagi™Kits. All the consumables you need in just a box.

discover the secrets of the first organism-on-chip

No more messy plates. No more manual handling. Unlock the full potential of small organisms with the microfluidic Nagi™ chips. More parallel conditions, more readouts, more possibilities.

Nagi™ chips relying on the patented wmw technology

Thanks to the development of our patented Microfluidic Worm Matrices (MWM) technology, we offer the possibility of confining worms within large arrays of microfluidic chambers in a simple, fast and reproducible way, by means of passive hydrodynamic worm-valves.

Start your experiment with a synchronized population of C. elegans worms at L1 stage (new-born nematodes) until they reach adulthood.

Start your experiment with a synchronized population of C. elegans worms at L4 stage (adult nematodes) to perform assays during their full lifespan.

Nagi™ assay starter Kits

One box, one experiment.

Starting you experiment was never that easy with the Nagi™ Assay Kits. All you need to run one full experiment on SydLab™ One. Plug&Play configuration to optimize your time and user-experience.
