The CNI can be configured in 20 different versions. It all depends on your needs.

On this page, you can find the configuration that is right for you. You can then request a quote for the selected option and we will get back to you about the selection. When you make your choice between chamber size and imprint options, you can see the selected configurations on a 3D image. You can also compare the selection with other choices by clicking around in the options.

When you have made your final choice, please fill out personal information, so we can get back to you and  press “Request Quote”. 

Options of the CNI

1. Select chamber size

The CNI tool is available in two different chamber sizes; 120 and 210 mm diameter. 

The former is suitable for imprinting on wafers up to 4” in size and the latter is suitable for imprinting on wafers up to 8” in size. 

Both chambers can handle all stamp and sample sizes, as long as they fit within the chamber diameter.

2. Select UV imprint option

The CNI tool performs UV nanoimprint at 365 nm and/or 405 nm.  The UV source is built into the lid of the CNI tool and the UV exposure happens through the membrane.  You have the options between the following: No UV source365 nm UV source405 nm UV source365 nm and 405 nm UV source

3. Select thermal imprint option

The CNI performs thermal nanoimprint and combined thermal and UV nanoimprint. 

The CNI lids with built-in UV source also works for thermal imprint with temperatures up to 200°C. You can order a high temperature lid that allows thermal imprint up to 250°C. If you choose to get no UV source, you will automatically get the high temperature lid. The options:   No thermal imprint option Thermal imprint up to 200°C Thermal imprint up to 250°C 

Choose the size of the CNI - 120 mm or 210 mm

1. Chamber size 120 mm

Choose between UV and thermal imprint options. Both fields are required to make a choice between the many different configurations.

3. Select thermal imprint option*The CNI tool performs thermal nanoimprint. It also performs combined thermal and UV nanoimprint. The UV transparent membranes in the CNI lid have a max temperature of 200°C, but we have red membranes that allow you to use temperatures up to 250°C. If you choose the high temperature option as well as a UV option, you will get an extra lid for the high temperature option. If you have not selected a UV option, you will automatically get the high temperature option. Please choose your Thermal imprint option No thermal imprint option Thermal imprint up to 200°C Thermal imprint up to 250°C
