Flood illumination

Single-surface metalens flood illuminators changing the future of 3D sensing. 

NILT offers single-surface metalens flood illuminators for applications such as structured light for 3D sensing, illumination for time-of-flight 3D sensing and face recognition. NILT both designs and processes these flood illuminator elements with the option of building them into full flood illuminator modules on demand.

Fit for applications including structured light for 3D sensing, illumination for time-of-flight 3D sensing and face recognition.

Advantages
Single-surface element allow for extreme miniaturization of optical system NILT’s flood illuminators can be designed for extreme FOI with high efficiency and profile quality Flood illuminators can be designed both for collimated as well as divergent light sources – increasing the number of possible use cases All flood illuminators can be optimized to customer requirements

NTLight® technology brings significant value to a range of applications. 

The MP-ready DOE catalog of diffusers includes elements that start from 63°x56° and go to 82°x72°, with multiple elements with a field of illumination in between.Standalone Diffusers deliver low-module height, high optical efficiency for energy saving, and low zero order.Pair diffusers with collimators for a sharp illumination intensity profile.Our DOE is polymer on glass substrates.
