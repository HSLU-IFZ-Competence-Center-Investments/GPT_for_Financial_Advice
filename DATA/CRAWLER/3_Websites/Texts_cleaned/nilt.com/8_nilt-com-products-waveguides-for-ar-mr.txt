Waveguides for AR/MR

For several years, NIL Technology has delivered masters for augmented and mixed reality (AR/MR) to some of the biggest players in the industry. 

We offer masters and sub-masters with blazed gratings, slanted gratings, and binary gratings. All three types of gratings can be combined in any ways and without any design constraints.

Surface relief waveguides for AR/MR are see-through waveguides, typically on high-refractive index glass. The waveguide includes surface relief gratings for in-coupling of the image signal from a projector, expansion in x and y, and out-coupling.

Typically, blazed- and slanted gratings are used for the coupling of light into the waveguide, and binary and slanted gratings are used for the pupil expansion and the out-coupling of the light.
