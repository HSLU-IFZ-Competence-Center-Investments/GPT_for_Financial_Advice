 readcrumb NavXT 7.3.0 
Previero  »  Single Rotor Shredders

The single-rotor shredders are particulary suitable for the pre-grinding of a wide range of materials.
The installation of the shredder Previero serie PR allows to automatize the grinding lines or the pre-treat-ment of the recycling plants.
By feeding the grinder with pre-cut material the production is increased and the energetic consumptions are reduced.

Copper & aluminium electric cables

Bales of plastic film	

Paper and cardboard packagings

The material loaded in bales or by means of spider is progressively chopped by the rotor.
During the rotation the rotor cuts a quantity of material proportional to the section of the rotating blade.
The shape and the number of blades are chosen according to the applications to optimize the cutting efficiency.
This peculiar operation of the single-rotor shredder enables the machine to self adjust the feeding avoiding any risk of obstruction.

Double direction of rotation to avoid bridges of material in the hopper
Operation with different cycles according to the materials, start-up with full hopper, reversal in case of overload
The particular shape of the blades and the special anti-wear labyrinths prevent the winding of materials on the rotor side such as fibers or films
Easy opening of the machine for cleaning or replacement of the blades
Quick and easy replacement of the fix and rotating blades
Low speed of rotation with reduced wear or consuption of the blades
Optimization in the design of the blades, with reduced cost of manufacture and sharpening.

Possibility of cut in the two directions of rotation.
Grate installation for fine shreddering.
Vertical hydraulic pusher for bulky products.
