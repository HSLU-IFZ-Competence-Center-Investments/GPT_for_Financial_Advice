Everything about The Rent Company!

About us

When Ronald van den Boogaard and his wife Sandra founded The Rent Company in 2004, their mission was clear: to make digital education accessible to every pupil. It all started with laptop carts. This way, every space could be transformed into a multimedia library in a flash.

Digitisation has been on the rise in recent years. A logical requirement of the market was: "Can you supply every pupil with their own laptop?" We still do that today via the Easy4u subscription. We offer special laptops for use in education for an affordable monthly sum including software, service, and accidental damage and theft insurance.

Over 700 schools and at least 280,000 pupils now use laptops from The Rent Company.

The Rent Company zal Easy4u ook in andere landen gaan aanbieden. We hebben de start gemaakt in België, waar we ons gevestigd hebben in Lubbeek.

Students and laptops? They are inextricably linked. Thanks to our full service provision via the Easy4u subscription, we make access to digital education easy and affordable.

Laptops on loan during repairs, super-fast service, a single point of contact for the school and the students, and accidental damage and theft insurance are included.
