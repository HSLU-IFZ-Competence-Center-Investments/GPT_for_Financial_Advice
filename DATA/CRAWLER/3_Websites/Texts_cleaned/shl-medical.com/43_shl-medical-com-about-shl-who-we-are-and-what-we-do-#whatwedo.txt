Who we are 

SHL is a world-leading provider of drug delivery solutions.

We have done this by forming genuine partnerships with our customers, working with them to ensure every project is a success.

We have unparalleled experience helping customers and patients all over the world. Regardless of how quickly their demands have changed, our agile and holistic support has always been there to provide the most reliable customer journey – from idea to product.

And the insights and skills we’ve gained through this experience couldn’t be timelier. Demand for both self-treatment and personalized healthcare is rapidly increasing, requiring better systems that better support patients. This means we must create solutions that ensure reliability and comfort for individuals as well as cost-efficiency and sustainability for every stakeholder.

As proven pathfinding pioneers, we embrace this challenge.

That’s why we partner with leading pharma and biotech companies to constantly develop and supply products and services that support, engage, and oversee patients whose quality of life relies on innovative self-treatment therapies. This we do with one purpose: “Enabling patients’ independence”. 

We design, develop, and manufacture advanced drug delivery devices such as autoinjectors, pen injectors, and innovative specialty delivery systems for large-volume and high-viscosity formulations.

We also provide design-to-build and contract manufacturing services for products like laboratory handling equipment, neurosurgical instruments, and industrial equipment for the integrated circuit and semiconductor industry.

By equipping our experienced development teams and skilled workforce with efficient manufacturing, we have developed a business model that works for everyone. It allows us to deliver comprehensive solutions for even the industry’s most demanding projects and to offer experience, excellence, and vision to customers and partners all over the world.
