EW ELINT/SIGINT antenna systems for boosted mission capabilities

SWISSto12 develops broadband antenna systems using innovative designs and 3D printing with outstanding amplitude and phase tracking features. The latter are key in the next generation of ELINT/SIGINT applications. Solutions include ridged horns, spiral antennas, mechanical housings and radomes. Qualified for maritime or airborne. 

Phase-matched horn antenna arrays

SWISSto12 offers solutions for amplitude- and phase-matched antenna arrays over traditional EW ELINT/SIGINT frequency bands, typically between 2 and 40 GHz and occasionally up to millimeter-wave.

Standard models 2-6 GHz or 6-18 GHz or 18-40 GHz (other frequency bands available on demand);
Elements available over various polarization configurations;
High RF-power compatible;
State-of-the-art amplitude and phase tracking capabilities;
Maritime and airborne qualified radomes available.
