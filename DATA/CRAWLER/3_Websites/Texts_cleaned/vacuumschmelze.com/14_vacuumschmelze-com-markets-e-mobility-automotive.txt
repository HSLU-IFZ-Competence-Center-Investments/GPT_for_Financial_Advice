Soft Magnetic Materials and Stamped Parts

 Inductive Components and Cores

 Permanent Magnets and Assemblies

 Energy Generation & Management

Vocational Training and Studies

Our portfolio comprises inductive components and electrical safety devices for all charging modes and meets the requirements of various standards such as IEC 62752 or UL2231.

We offer not only benchmark material for EMI solutions, but also cores and common mode chokes based on our nanocrystalline VITROPERM® material.

 Components for Electric Motors and Generators

Whether you are looking for materials, permanent magnets, or complete stator and rotor assemblies, we provide  a comprehensive range of solutions for electric drives.

Precise positioning sensors start with best in class materials as well as thereof made stamped parts and permanent magnets. We offer a unique set of solutions for this demanding application.

 Actuators for Injection Systems

Materials based on cobalt-iron are characterized by their very high polarization saturation and allow high dynamics and size reduced actuators which fit perfectly to their demands.

 Root element of PhotoSwipe. Must have class pswp. 

 Background of PhotoSwipe.
 It's a separate element as animating opacity is faster than rgba(). 

 Slides wrapper with overflow:hidden. 

 Container that holds slides.
 PhotoSwipe keeps only 3 of them in the DOM to save memory.
 Don't modify these 3 pswp__item elements, data is added later on. 

 Default (PhotoSwipeUI_Default) interface on top of sliding area. Can be changed. 

 Controls are self-explanatory. Order can be changed. 

 Preloader demo http://codepen.io/dimsemenov/pen/yyBWoR 
 element will get class pswp__preloader--active when preloader is running
