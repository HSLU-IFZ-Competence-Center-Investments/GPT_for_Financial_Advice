 Components for Electric Motors and Generators

Whether you are looking for materials, permanent magnets, or complete stator and rotor assemblies, we provide a comprehensive range of solutions for electric drives.   

Our power electronics solutions are comprised of current measurement devices such as closed loop current sensors and differential current sensors as well as filter cores and common mode chokes for EMC applications.

We offer not only benchmark material for EMI solutions, but also cores and common mode chokes based on our nanocrystalline VITROPERM material.

Whether you are looking for current transformers, current sensors or AC/DC-sensitive safety devices, we offer solutions which meet the expectations towards highest quality and tightest tolerances.

Precise positioning sensors start with best in class materials as well as thereof made stamped parts and permanent magnets. We offer a unique set of solutions for this demanding application.

 Root element of PhotoSwipe. Must have class pswp. 

 Background of PhotoSwipe.
 It's a separate element as animating opacity is faster than rgba(). 

 Slides wrapper with overflow:hidden. 

 Container that holds slides.
 PhotoSwipe keeps only 3 of them in the DOM to save memory.
 Don't modify these 3 pswp__item elements, data is added later on. 

 Default (PhotoSwipeUI_Default) interface on top of sliding area. Can be changed. 

 Controls are self-explanatory. Order can be changed. 

 Preloader demo http://codepen.io/dimsemenov/pen/yyBWoR 
 element will get class pswp__preloader--active when preloader is running
