VR accessories and peripherals.

Accessories and peripherals play a pivotal role in enhancing the VR experience. They can improve interactivity and comfort, making virtual reality an even more captivating and immersive realm. Whether you’re a gaming enthusiast or a professional user proper accessories can undoubtedly elevate your VR experience to new heights of excitement and realism.

One of the most popular peripherals for VR is the VR controller. These handheld devices come in various forms, providing users with a sense of presence and interactivity within the virtual environment. Equipped with motion sensors and buttons, these controllers enable users to navigate through virtual worlds, interact with objects, and perform various actions with natural hand movements. Varjo headsets are compatible with the most popular controllers such as the Valve Index.

Another essential peripheral is the VR sensor, also known as the tracking system. These devices, placed strategically in the user’s play area, track the movements of the headset and controllers, ensuring accurate positioning and smooth in-app interactions. High-quality tracking systems are essential for delivering a seamless and immersive VR experience. This is why Varjo headsets rely on outside-in tracking from external base stations or lighthouses. For 360 coverage, we recommend at least two Steam VR 2.0 base stations placed diagonally at the corners of the desired area.

VR headphones or earphones are also commonly used with VR headsets. These audio peripherals provide high-fidelity sound, crucial for enhancing immersion and situational awareness within the virtual environment. By precisely replicating sounds from different directions, users can pinpoint sources, heightening their overall gaming or multimedia experience. Audio requirements vary from use case to another, which is why all Varjo headsets have a 3,5mm audio jack to allow users to connect their preferred headphones to the HMD.
