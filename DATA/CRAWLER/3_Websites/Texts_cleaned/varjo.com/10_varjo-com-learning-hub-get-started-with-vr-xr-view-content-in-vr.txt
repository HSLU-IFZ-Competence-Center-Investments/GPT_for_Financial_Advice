What kind of content can I view in VR? Can I view video content?

Typically, any kind of 3D assets can be viewed in virtual reality (VR), such as 3D CAD models, 3D scanned environments (including photogrammetry scans) or even 360° videos. The 3D assets need to be compiled in game engines such as Unity and Unreal Engine to be viewable in VR. 360-degree videos can be viewed in VR with specific applications such as the Steam 360 video player.

If you would like to use your standard 2D computer applications such as Microsoft Word, Outlook, Visual studio code, or even view your pictures, YouTube videos, or other 2D content on your VR headset, this can also be accomplished. All Varjo headsets are equipped with a virtual desktop feature called  Varjo Workspace. The feature can be enabled and disabled via the Varjo Base software, and you can reposition and resize the virtual desktop to your preference. The virtual desktop allows you to bring in any Windows application to VR or XR, bridging the 2D and 3D worlds together.
