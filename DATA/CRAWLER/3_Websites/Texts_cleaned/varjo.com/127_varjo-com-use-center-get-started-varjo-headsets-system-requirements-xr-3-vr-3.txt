Note about laptop graphics cards

Laptop graphics cards with identical names can perform differently depending on factors such as the thermal design of the laptop and amount of memory on the card.

Some key terms to keep in mind when comparing graphics cards:

Total Graphics Power (TGP): The maximum power consumption of a graphics card, which gives an indication of its maximum performance.
GPU memory: Graphics cards come in many variants with different amounts of memory on the card, which also affects performance.

These are the hardware requirements when using XR-3 and VR-3 with a laptop computer:

One of the following or better:

AMD Ryzen 7

Graphics card (GPU)1
High-end NVIDIA Ada generation laptop GPU with a Total Graphics Power (TGP) of 150W or more:

NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090
NVIDIA RTX 5000 Ada

High-end NVIDIA Ampere generation laptop GPU with a Total Graphics Power (TGP) of 165W or more:

NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080

Connectivity
Option 1. Using two third-party Mini DisplayPort–DisplayPort adapters:

2 x USB-A 3.0 / 3.1
2 x Mini DisplayPort

Note that the adapter must support 8k video and DisplayPort 1.4 with Display Stream Compression (DSC). See a list of tested and compatible adapters.

Option 2. Using two Varjo laptop adapters sold separately:

2 x USB-C 3.0/3.1, with support for Alternate Mode

Option 3. Combination of Option A and Option B, using one third-party Mini DisplayPort–DisplayPort adapter and one Varjo laptop adapter:

1 x Mini DisplayPort
1 x USB-A 3.0 / 3.1
1 x USB-C 3.0/3.1, with support for Alternate Mode

In all options, note the following requirements for the ports:

Mini DisplayPort ports must be routed directly to the dedicated NVIDIA GPU
In Option 2 and Option 3 when using Varjo laptop adapter, the USB-C port must be routed directly to the dedicated NVIDIA GPU and include support for Alternate Mode.

See Cabling options for XR-3 and VR-3 for illustrations of the connectivity options.

1 While mobile and desktop GPUs may have identical product names, performance is significantly lower when using mobile GPUs. Note that AMD graphics cards are currently not supported.

2 Storage space required to install Varjo Base.
