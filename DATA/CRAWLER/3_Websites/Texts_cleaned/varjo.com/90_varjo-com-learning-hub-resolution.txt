Capturing VR or XR experiences

Just like for any other display device, the resolution of a VR headset refers to the number of pixels that can be displayed at one time. As an example, the Varjo XR-4 offers a resolution of 3840 x 3744 pixels per eye. Resolution is best measured as pixels per degree (or PPD) in a user’s field of view.

Varjo XR-4’s resolution of 51 pixels per degree delivers over 50% wider field of view (120° x 105°) compared to previous-generation devices, with double the display brightness (200 nits) and a wider color gamut with 96% DCI-P3.

Varjo Aero features the highest resolution of any consumer device today (over 35 PPD), allowing users to see and experience VR environments in a crystal-clear way. With dual mini-LED displays, crystal-clear aspheric lenses, and a 115° field of view for stunning edge-to-edge clarity, the device offers a massive step up in visual fidelity over consumer-grade virtual reality headsets.
