								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://www.shl-medical.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/External-website_Fujifilm.jpg" alt="External Website Fujifilm" class="wp-image-27504"/><figcaption>FUJIFILM Diosynth Biotechnologies expands finished goods autoinjector services in Denmark with the addition of SHL Medical’s Molly® autoinjector platform</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>FUJIFILM Diosynth Biotechnologies, a world-leading contract development and manufacturing organization (CDMO) for biologics, vaccines, advanced therapies and oncolytic viruses today announced that it will expand its finished goods autoinjector services through a non-exclusive strategic partnership agreement with SHL Medical (SHL), a world-leading solutions provider of advanced drug delivery systems. </strong></p>



<p>The partnership, part of SHL’s Alliance Management Program, aims to streamline processes and enhance efficiency for pharmaceutical and biotech companies offering self-injection device finished goods services primarily with SHL’s flagship platform Molly®. FUJIFILM Diosynth Biotechnologies will offer pre-validated final assembly services for Molly autoinjectors for its global customers with increased capacity of up to 30 million units per year beginning early 2025.</p>
<p>Autoinjectors deliver medicines in a patient-centric manner using specifically designed devices that administer medications through a subcutaneous or intramuscular route. Pre-filled injectors have a projected growth rate of approximately 10% per year between now and 2030<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a> due to the rise in self-administration especially for chronic diseases including diabetes and obesity. Autoinjector medicines can improve patient safety by reducing potential drug contamination and offer ease of use and convenience for patients who are eligible for self-administration. </p>
<p>“Partnering with SHL will expand FUJIFILM Diosynth Biotechnologies’ ability to offer top-quality, high-speed final assembly of autoinjectors to customers seeking our CDMO services,” said Kenneth Bilenberg, chief operating officer, and executive vice president, large-scale business unit, FUJIFILM Diosynth Biotechnologies. “Having access to SHL’s full network of solutions and services will enhance our ability to support our customers in improving patient access using autoinjector medicines.”  </p>
<p>The strategic partnership will allow SHL to recommend FUJIFILM Diosynth Biotechnologies for final assembly of the Molly autoinjector to customers seeking CDMO services, leading to faster development, streamlined communications, reduced supply chain risks, and a more sustainable manufacturing footprint. </p>
<p>“Expanding our finished goods services at our site in Hillerød, Denmark underscores our commitment to fulfill the needs of our customers,” said Christian Houborg, site head, FUJIFILM Diosynth Biotechnologies, Hillerød, Denmark. “When current drug product expansions and automation projects are complete, our increased capacity and capabilities will enable us to improve patient access to life-impacting medicines, saving our customers time, money, and reducing their products’ carbon footprint by providing drug substance, drug product and finished goods services from our Denmark site.” </p>
<p>“A number of customers with manufacturing infrastructure in Europe have sought our guidance in recommending a trusted final assembly partner that can support their commitment to a localized supply chain,” said SHL Medical Chief Growth Officer Markus Puusepp. “It is with great pleasure that we will now be able to recommend FUJIFILM Diosynth Biotechnologies to them with the full confidence that the collaboration will further support their needs for faster timelines to clinic and to market.”</p>
<p><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a> Based on Fujifilm internal research as of December 2023. </p>

<p>SHL’s continuous improvement efforts have been recognized with a total of three awards from Taiwan’s two prestigious competitions – Excellent Practice Award (EPA) from the Association of Quality Manager and Taiwan Continuous Improvement Awards (TCIA) from Corporate Synergy Development Center.</p>
<p>The winning projects from Supply Chain, Tooling, and Continuous Improvement teams highlighted increased efficiency in our manufacturing operations, including freeing up warehouse space through JIT (just-in-time) methods and cutting down tool repair time through the ECRS method (Eliminate, Combine, Rearrange, Simplify). These awards position SHL as an excellent example for companies from other industries, proving our competitive edge as having modernized, state-of-the-art manufacturing facilities.</p>
<p>In upholding lean manufacturing principles, SHL understands the importance of driving efficiency while ensuring consistent quality output throughout all manufacturing operations to support the growth of our organization. By continuously optimizing processes, SHL is poised to progress forward in supporting customers with better solutions in the production of their autoinjector products.</p>
<figure id="attachment_27194" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-27194" style="width: 2128px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-full wp-image-27194" src="https://www.shl-medical.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/MicrosoftTeams-image-85.jpg" alt="Group photo AQM award" width="2128" height="1419" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-27194" class="wp-caption-text"><em>Group photo AQM award.</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>General Manager of the Taiwan site Sebastian Feng said, “Winning these awards is a testimony to SHL’s efforts in driving continuous improvement values within our organization. It is important that all members of our company are onboard with this mindset as we continue to optimize our processes and practices in Taiwan, but also support the journey of our global expansion initiatives in building manufacturing capabilities across Europe, Asia, and the USA.”</p>
<p>Associate Director of the Continuous Improvement (CI) department Tracy Pedreso also commented, “I am extremely glad that our colleagues are embracing change and continuing to pursue excellence. For the past two years, individuals&#8217; and teams&#8217; passion for CI initiatives did not just end upon the completion of their project. Rather, they continued to the point of showcasing their innovative ideas into prestigious competitions. These two consecutive years of receiving awards are a validation of our good operational practices, and that we are in the right direction in embedding a lean culture mindset in our organization. The recognition we get is a great opportunity for SHL to share know-how, to continue challenging ourselves, and to learn from other industries as well.”</p>
<p>As part of the company’s core values to drive simplicity in all facets of its operations, SHL’s commitment to continuous improvement will persist in strengthening our manufacturing capabilities to better serve our customers.</p>

<p>In the Sustainability Issue of ONdrug Delivery magazine, SHL Medical’s ESG Project Manager discusses the development of single-use autoinjectors in the context of SHL’s sustainable design principles and decarbonization goals.</p>
<p>The article opens the discussion by initially providing a brief history of the concept of sustainability in recent decades while putting into perspective the evolution of home-based parental treatments. In this context, Dr. Bruce introduces SHL’s sustainable design principles – the company’s approach to acting sustainably toward the development of autoinjector medical devices. The article also highlights the crucial role of data in shaping SHL’s evidence-based sustainability targets and outlines the company&#8217;s near-term commitments to reducing its environmental impact across the autoinjector value chain.</p>
