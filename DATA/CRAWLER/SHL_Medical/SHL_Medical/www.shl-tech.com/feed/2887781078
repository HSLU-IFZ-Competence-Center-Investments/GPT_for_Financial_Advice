<p>In a notable achievement highlighting its dedication to innovation and excellence, SHL Technologies, an experienced contract manufacturer and original equipment manufacturer (OEM) for the medtech and industrial sectors, has received the prestigious ‘Supplier Award’ from its longstanding partner, Sartorius AG – an internationally recognized pharmaceutical and laboratory equipment supplier.</p>



<p>Presented by Henning Wuelker, OU Systems at Sartorius AG, the award ceremony took place during the annual Supplier Day conference on November 7-8 at Sartorius Campus in Goettingen, Germany. This exclusive two-day networking event brought together 20 leading global suppliers for an engaging workshop, providing a platform for the exchange of insights on industry’s trends and advancements.</p>



<p>The 2023 Supplier Day also marked the introduction of a competitive element where participants were challenged to submit proposals focusing on cost, quality, and customer-centric solutions. SHL Technologies distinguished itself by presenting four comprehensive proposals, addressing various optimization aspects, including alternative supplier and process for Reaction Injection Molding (RIM), alternative supplier for mechanical parts, supply chain management, and continuous improvement.</p>



<p>Ben Lin, Manager at SHL Technologies, stated, “Through these value-engineering proposals, we aim to develop tailored approaches that create values for our partners.” He emphasized the company’s established <a href="https://www.shl-tech.com/expertise/#section2">supply chain network</a> and extensive industry knowledge as instrumental to the company’s success in securing the award.</p>



<p>David Johnston-Raw, Main Category Manager at Sartorius AG, commented, “SHL Technologies stood out among our suppliers. The company’s proposals demonstrated not only expertise in identifying growth opportunities and developing value-added solutions, but also a deep understanding of our business model and how the supply chain functions.”</p>

<p>Expressing gratitude for the achievement, General Manager of SHL Technologies, Gabor Papp remarked, “This award is a testament to SHL Technologies’ commitment to innovation and excellence. We take pride in our partnership with Sartorius AG and look forward to delivering other valuable, forward-thinking solutions.”</p><p>The post <a href="https://www.shl-tech.com/shl-technologies-receives-supplier-award-from-sartorius/">SHL Technologies receives Supplier Award from Sartorius</a> first appeared on <a href="https://www.shl-tech.com">SHL Technologies </a>.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>On Monday, February 6, a 7.8 magnitude earthquake and several aftershocks struck south-eastern Türkiye and northern Syria, killing thousands of people and leaving many more injured and homeless. The humanitarian situation in these regions is dire – especially across Syria, where even before the recent natural disasters, many buildings and infrastructure were already fragile and in danger of collapse due to airstrikes and bombardments during the country’s civil war. Harsh weather conditions continue to worsen the situation for the victims as well as for the rescue teams who are racing to reach people.</p>



<p>“We are shocked and deeply saddened by the scale of this disaster and the toll it has taken on the people affected. The guiding principle of ethical behavior and humanity is firmly ingrained in our corporate culture and our values. As a natural consequence helping the victims of this tragedy with medical aid, safe shelter, and emergency items is a matter of personal importance to us”, emphasizes CEO Ulrich Faessler.</p>



<p>To support those affected by this devastating earthquake, SHL Technologies, along with SHL Medical has donated US$50,000 each to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) – two charitable organizations the company already <a href="https://www.shl-medical.com/shl-donates-chf150000-to-support-humanitarian-aid-in-ukraine/">collaborated with to support humanitarian aid in Ukraine</a>. UNHCR is helping those who had to flee their homes with tents, mattresses, blankets, cooking and hygiene items, as well as warm winter clothes. Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières provides immediate support to health facilities by donating emergency medical equipment and sending ambulance coaches and medical staff to reinforce their teams.</p>



<p>In addition to the company donation, SHL is encouraging colleagues from across the organization’s global sites to make individual contributions.</p>

<p>SHL Technologies and Innovation Zed, SHL’s partner for connected pen injector solutions, are pleased to announce the 2022 launched InsulCheck DOSE, an add-on device that transforms traditional pen injectors into smart, connected solutions.</p>
<p>InsulCheck DOSE by Innovation Zed is a reusable add-on device that uses Bluetooth® technology to automatically transfer injection time and dialed dose volume to a smartphone application. It features an OLED display that counts up the time elapsed since last injection and also captures device ambient temperature as well as mounting/unmounting activities. Data from the device can be shared with a companion software application for automated logging of injection information.</p>
<p>SHL Technologies is Innovation Zed’s manufacturing partner for InsulCheck DOSE and its <a href="https://www.shl-tech.com/our_solutions/medical-device-add-on/">predecessor technologies</a> for the InsulCheck range. InsulCheck DOSE was designed in collaboration with <a href="https://www.shl-medical.com">SHL Medical</a>, the parent company of SHL Technologies.</p>
<p>“We are constantly strengthening our manufacturing capabilities for the medtech sector in order to supply our partners with flexible solutions that contribute to better health for more people. We have worked very closely with Innovation Zed to ensure that each step of the manufacturing process is executed to the highest quality standards. We are proud of this collaboration and look forward to bringing InsulCheck DOSE to patients,” said Gabor Papp, general manager as SHL Technologies.</p>
<p>“SHL Technologies has consistently delivered high-quality products and services despite the COVID-19 pandemic. As we prepare to enter production at the end of Q2 in 2022, we are confident that the partnership will allow us to serve our existing and potential customers with the best-in-class connected solutions for their pen injectors,” said Dr. Dean Minnock, CEO at Innovation Zed.</p>
<p>All InsulCheck devices are compatible with a range of<a href="https://www.insulcheck.com/products"> reusable and disposable insulin pen injectors</a> on the market. Compatibility is built through a customizable sleeve, which allows the devices to support all injector pens already on the market or under development. InsulCheck DOSE also features a built-in firmware over-the-air (FOTA) capability, which allows continuous optimization of the device&#8217;s firmware even when deployed in the field.</p>
<p>InsulCheck DOSE will enter production at the end of Q2 2022.

<p>The recent surge of COVID cases in Taiwan has prompted SHL Medical to take action on tightening the precautionary COVID restrictions in Taiwan’s office and production sites, following the government’s decision to raise the pandemic alert warning. Since the outbreak of the pandemic, the company has taken proactive measures to protect the health and safety of our staff and ensure the continuity of drug delivery products for our customers and end-users.</p>

We are constantly tracking the government’s policies concerning COVID developments, so as to adapt and make adjustments to our manpower allocation or shift schedules.</p>



<p>To this end, we have worked tirelessly and relentlessly to ensure business continuity, as well as preventing the potential spread of COVID within company quarters. Our frequent travel history survey and on-site infirmary staff support us in tracking colleagues’ health and safety.</p>



<p>Our aim is to continue business operations while still providing quality service to our customers during such critical times.</p><p>The post <a href="https://www.shl-tech.com/shls-covid-19-statement-regarding-taiwans-case/">SHL’s COVID-19 Statement regarding Taiwan’s case</a> first appeared on <a href="https://www.shl-tech.com">SHL Technologies </a>.</p>]]></content:encoded>
