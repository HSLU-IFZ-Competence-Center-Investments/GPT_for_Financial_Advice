About us
A Modern Pest Control Company

Anticimex is one of the top four global players in the pest control market by revenue, and is the leading player in the digitally-enabled pest control market based on the number of reported installations of digitally-enabled pest control units in 2021.

The group's history dates back to 1934, and it has since grown its business both organically and through acquisitions. The Group operates approximately 240 branches across 37 platforms in 21 countries across Europe, Asia, Pacific, North America, and Latin America. The Group offers pest control services and certain additional complementary services in selected markets, including hygiene and building environment services. The Group also delivers pest control and building environment services through insurance arrangements in Europe.

The expansion of the Group’s operations has been enabled through strong organic growth, digitalization, and acquisitions in existing and new markets, largely driven by the implementation of a decentralized branch-based business model in 2015. A model that leverages the local knowledge and expertise of individual branch managers, best practice sharing, as well as the launch of the Group’s technology-driven SMART solutions. 
Analyzing market dynamics
Responding to evolving market demands

The pest control market is highly fragmented with significant potential for consolidation. The industry is further characterized by a range of structural drivers, including increasing pest prevalence due to urbanization, globalization and climate change, a decreasing societal tolerance of pests due to cultural change, increased purchasing power, and increasing health, and safety regulation. The Group believes that it is well-positioned to leverage these structural growth trends in its favor.
