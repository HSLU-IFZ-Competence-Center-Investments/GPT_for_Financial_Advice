Our History
A family business founded in 1934

Anticimex was founded in 1934 in Sweden as a family business offering a “no bed bugs guarantee”, which expanded during the 1950s and 1960s to include insurance in connection with its pest control services in Sweden.

The Group expanded its operations internationally outside of Sweden in the following decades, beginning with its launch in Norway in 1973, and in the late 1980s, the Group launched its building inspections and food hygiene services. In the 2000s, the Group expanded further across Europe into Denmark, Finland, Germany and the Netherlands. Since then, the Group has grown to become a global business, offering pest control and ancillary services in 21 countries across the world.

The Group’s transformation from a European multi-service company to a global pest control company was achieved through a strategic shift, involving the divestment of non-core business activities and a re-focusing on its recurring pest control offering. Strong growth, digitalization, and expansion in existing and new markets through around 350+ value-enhancing acquisitions also contributed to this transformation. For example, in 2013, the Group acquired the local pest control businesses of ISS in Australia, Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, Spain, and Switzerland.

 In 2015, the Group established the Anticimex Model, which focuses on its branches as the cornerstone of the Group. The Group also acquired a 20 percent stake in WiseCon A/S, a Danish supplier of digitally-enabled pest control products and accelerated its digital SMART concept, which uses intelligent traps and sensors to monitor and control pests. 

The Group expanded its operations into Asia through the acquisition of SITA Pest Control & Fumigation Service in Singapore. In July, the Group entered the United States market through the acquisition of Bug Doctor, American Pest and GreenStar Termite & Pest Control.

Through acquisitions, Anticimex expanded in Asia (DC Hygiene, WiseCon) and North America (Viking Termite, Modern Pest, Mid-Atlantic Pest). WiseCon's acquisition led to the Anticimex Innovation Center in Helsinge, Denmark, currently the R&D hub for the Group.

The Group entered France through the acquisition of Danton and further expanded in the North American market through the acquisition of Turner Pest Control, which has operations in Florida, and Killingsworth Environmental of the Carolinas, which has operations in North Carolina.

In 2019, Anticimex expanded further in the North American market by acquiring Waynes Pest Control, which has operations throughout Alabama, Mississippi, and Tennessee, and JP McHale Pest Management in New York State

During the fourth quarter of 2020, the Group completed its first acquisitions in Arizona, California, and Colorado. In May 2021, the Group entered its 20th country, Colombia, with the acquisition of Palmera Junior. 

By 2022, the Group made a big step by entering the UK, with the acquisition of Pestokill, one of the largest players in the country.
