CFP Energy win multiple awards in the Environmental Market Rankings 2023-2024

Following a successful year, CFP Energy is delighted to have been voted a winner in the Environmental Finance Environmental Market Rankings 2023-2024. CFP Energy were voted as winners in two awards, and runner-up in a further two. 	

Following a successful year, CFP Energy is delighted to have been voted a winner in the Environmental Finance Environmental Market Rankings 2023-2024. The rankings acknowledge CFP Energy's outstanding contributions and expertise in carbon markets and emissions trading, solidifying their position as industry leaders.

CFP Energy were voted as winners in the following awards: 

UK Trading System: Best Trading Company, OTC/Spot
EU Emissions Trading System: Best Trading Company, Options & Futures

Additionally, CFP Energy earned recognition as a runner-up in the following categories: 

EU Emissions Trading System: Best Trading Company, OTC/Spot
Energy Attribute Certificates - Europe: Best Trading Company

These awards are particularly pleasing given the rankings are based on client votes. We hope this underscores CFP Energy's efforts to provide clients with market leading solutions to manage compliance in carbon markets, particularly in the and EU ETS.

The rankings come amid a period of lower allowance prices and bearish fundamentals in the short term but companies should prepare for the challenges ahead in both the UK and EU ETS.

Tim Atkinson, Director of Carbon Sales and Structuring at CFP Energy, remarked, "Given future price forecasts expect allowance prices to be back over €100/£100 per CO2e by 2027, our view is that ETS operators face a choice on whether to decarbonise over the next 5 years, budget for higher carbon prices or use the current market to lock in compliance costs now whilst allowance prices are at favourable levels.”

With ETS targets set to tighten by 2030 and beyond, CFP Energy look forward to working with our customers to develop effective risk management strategies for carbon markets.
