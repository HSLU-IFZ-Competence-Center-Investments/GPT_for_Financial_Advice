Voluntary carbon

An essential on the route to Net Zero

Voluntary carbon credits enable organisations to offset unavoidable emissions, prepare for forthcoming regulations and align with evolving stakeholder expectations.

The Voluntary Carbon Market, upon which credits are exchanged, presents a further opportunity to bridge the annual $600 - $800bn (est) financing gap to combat biodiversity loss and climate change.

To drive your organisation towards net zero while supporting the development of sustainable projects around the world, contact our team now.

High quality due diligence

CFP Energy screens all early-stage investment opportunities by applying a rigorous due diligence process featuring proprietary carbon project quality assessment tools and thorough satellite analysis.

Careful due diligence is imperative in mitigating voluntary carbon market risk and generating a reliable source of high-quality carbon credits for our clients.

Plan strategically. To develop a balanced emission reduction strategy that aligns with short-term needs and long-term goals.

Prioritise transparency. To avoid damning claims of greenwashing, ensure credits reflect genuine emissions reductions, coming through legitimate projects.

Understand the market. The voluntary carbon market is particularly opaque, liquid and juvenile – navigate it with a trusted partner.

Providing immediate access. To existing markets, as well as our own high-quality portfolio. We can also leverage broker relationships for specific requirements.

Managing price risk. Hedge against price fluctuations and secure known costs through futures and forwards contracts.

Offering long-term arrangements. Become sole off-taker of the credits generated by green projects in our own derisked and thoroughly vetted portfolio.
