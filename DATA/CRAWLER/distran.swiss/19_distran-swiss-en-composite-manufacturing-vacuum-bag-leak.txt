Composite Manufacturing Detect Vacuum Leaks

Speeding up leak detection in vacuum bags with ultrasound imaging

Composite manufacturing requires a perfect vacuum integrity before products can be cured. Any leak in a bag can compromise the final product quality and will require additional time for repair.

The methods available to check for leaks are tedious, time-consuming and heavily user-dependent.

Ultrasound imaging is a novel technology that provides a real-time visualization of leaks from a distance. With an ultrasound camera, anyone can pinpoint vacuum leaks 10x faster than before, which improves the process efficiency.

Why Composite Manufacturers choose Ultra CE

Testimonial: “Ultra CE significantly improves our process”

“80% of the leaks usually happen at similar locations. The remaining 20% are extremely time consuming, and often impossible, to locate with traditional methods. The leaks we cannot find will cause production delays as well as defects in parts. 

Ultra CE pinpoints any leaks instantly.
It’s a game changer: results are immediate and reliable.”

Process Engineer, Equipment Development

Vacuum Leak detection by ultrasound imaging

How ultrasound imaging works on vacuum leaks

Vacuum leaks create turbulence in their vicinity, on both sides of the envelope. Turbulence, in turn, create sounds and ultrasound, which propagate to the sensor. The 124 ultrasound transducers of Ultra CE capture the ultrasound waves at different times (diﬀering by less than a millisecond). These little time differences are processed by the device in real-time to display the location of the sound source; the leak.

Distran ultrasound camera pinpoints leaks instantly. Inspection results are immediate and easy to understand. Anyone can conduct comprehensive, reliable, actionable leak inspections.

Restore sealing integrity on vacuum bags

Ultra CE is an essential step to ensure the quality of composite products

“Ultra CE drastically reduces the repairs required after autoclave, as it detects many more leaks than the traditional methods beforehand.

Resulting in an enhanced end product quality.”

Process Engineer, Equipment Development

As shown below, after locating a leak, sealing integrity can be immediately restored.

Ultra CE will confirm if tightness has been reinstated.

Key advantages of ultrasonic imaging for leak detection on vacuum bags

Ultra CE speeds up vacuum leak inspections by 10x, especially when compared to traditional single microphone detectors.

Ultra CE is easy-to-use so anyone can find leaks reliably. Pictures from the camera are self-explanatory.

Ultra CE detects leaks from a few meters. No area gets overlooked.

Ultra CE actively filters background noises and detects leaks even in noisy areas such as production halls.
