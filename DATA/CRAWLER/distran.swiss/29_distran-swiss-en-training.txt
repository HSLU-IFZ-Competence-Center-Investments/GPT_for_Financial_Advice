Training is essential for the success of your measurements.
We will train you so that you can make the best out of Ultra Pro.
If you choose to buy a discovery package or a device, we won’t leave you alone.

Our training courses are performed by certified instructors, that have a long experience with the device and performed many inspections in industrial environments.

Moreover, all instructors are required to hold the Distran Training Certificate Level 2.

Making the training a success

Preparation is the key to all trainings. In particular, making sure that the participants and the trainer will be able to seamlessly access the industrial site to perform leak searches is essential to a successful training. The closer the training is to the conditions that participants will later use the device in, the more efficient the training will be.

To prepare for the on-site training, the participant are invited to attend the online training. You will receive the access codes together with the instructions for the onsite training.
