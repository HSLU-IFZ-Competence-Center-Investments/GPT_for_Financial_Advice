Novel gas leak detection solution

Expand your service range with a novel and versatile leak detection technology

The Distran ultrasound camera Ultra Pro X allows for an immediate visualization of gas leaks on industrial facilities. This intrinsically safe hand-held camera is able to detect leaks of any gas type from a safe distance, only by the specific ultrasound they generate.

Service providers deploying Ultra Pro X are able to deliver actionable reports the same day as the inspection with precise and clear location of the leaks. The integrated software help them to classify leaks by degree of danger and/or cost, as well as to evaluate the cost of each leak.
