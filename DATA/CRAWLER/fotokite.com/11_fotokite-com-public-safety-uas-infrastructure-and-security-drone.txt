For security applications Fotokite is typically deployed from security vehicles or optionally offered as a standalone asset configuration for remote infrastructure sites. 

Unlike the traditional security drone, Fotokite provides security teams with mobile infrastructure that can be deployed automatically upon event triggering, at regular intervals, or on command. 

Security control rooms are able to maintain real-time situational awareness with optional remote video streaming directly from install sites. 

More than just a security drone, Fotokite Sigma offers the ability to maintain 24/7 live streaming information within seconds of deployment, without the need for piloting and GPS dependency.
