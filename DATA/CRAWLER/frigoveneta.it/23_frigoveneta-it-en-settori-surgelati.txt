SYSTEMS Reliability and efficiency

Cold that is constant, measurable and safe

We, at Frigoveneta, have developed specific solutions for storing frozen products: a dual system to avoid the risks of cooling stoppage, electronic valves, electronic fans and inverter engines to reduce energy consumption, in addition to setting time bands in order to take advantage of lower energy prices.

We can also provide the design and delivery of a warehouse turnkey solution (panels, insulation, doors, lights, loading platforms), with the advantage of having a single contact point and a result that’s in line with the needs of each client.

The smooth functioning of each system is guaranteed by the Telegest system, which enables a direct link to the Remote MonitoringCenter, while the Unigest system energy consumption data is always at hand.
