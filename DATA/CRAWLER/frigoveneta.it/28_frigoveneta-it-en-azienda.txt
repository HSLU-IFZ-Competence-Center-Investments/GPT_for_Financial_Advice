COMPANY An Italian success

 Frigoveneta was founded in 1980 in Villa Bartolomea (Verona), initially for commercial installations, and then moved to the industrial refrigeration and Mass Retail Channels (MRC) sectors. 

 In 1998 its legal definition changed and Frigoveneta become a Limited Liability Company and in 2000 it moved to its new production and administrative headquarters, still located in Villa Bartolomea.
In 2002, the constant pursuit of high production and management standards enabled it to obtain the UNI EN ISO 9001: 2000 quality certification.
In 2004 Frigoveneta became a Joint Stock Company and in 2005 Frigoveneta Service srl was established: a company specializing in after sales technical support.
In 2013 Frigoveneta spa decided to share its technical expertise and experience and was recognized by Bureau Veritas as Assessment Body, via Regulation CE303 / 2008 andPresidential Decree No. 43 dated 27/01/2012. As a result, courses and exams for obtaining the "Refrigerator Technician License" are held at the companyâ€™s main offices.
The growth of Frigoveneta continues: in 2008 the first expansion of its new production headquarters took place, followed by a second extension in 2015, bringing the company's total area to 63,000 square meters, of which 15,000 are covered.
