ENERGY EFFICIENCY / Telegest

Telegest

TeleGest is the visualisation interface that allows you to control your system and individual utilities regardless of what your business is:

The refrigeration utilities are connected to the local supervision terminal at the customer’s site from where the entire system can be monitored and the parameters adjusted. The Modbus protocol was chosen as the communication system between the utilities because it is simple and reliable, in addition to being an open system and easy to maintain.

TeleGest communicates with all major hardware manufacturers for the control of refrigeration utilities. It can also be integrated with all Frigoveneta systems, such as UniGest and UniCalor.
