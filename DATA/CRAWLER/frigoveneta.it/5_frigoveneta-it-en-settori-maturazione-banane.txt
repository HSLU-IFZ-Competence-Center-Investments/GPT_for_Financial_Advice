Frigoveneta technology for banana ripening

Banana storage and ripening chambers can be equipped with curtain or airbag systems, two equally effective solutions for the homogeneous distribution of air inside them.

TeleGest for banana ripening

Each plant is equipped with the TeleGest system thanks to which it is possible to:

Customise the ripening and storage cycles
Manage ventilation completely, including the speed of all fans
Manage the air exchange cycles
Manage the ethylene concentration
Be constantly connected to the Frigoveneta remote control centre
Receive real-time technical assistance from Frigoveneta technicians

TeleGest is Industry 4.0 ready certified

UniCalor: Free heat for banana ripening

UniCalor is the Frigoveneta system that recovers the condensation heat generated by the operation of the refrigeration system. This heat, which would otherwise be dispersed in the environment, is entirely recovered and used to heat the product and can possibly be used to heat other environments (e.g. offices, services, etc.). This allows for significant energy savings.
