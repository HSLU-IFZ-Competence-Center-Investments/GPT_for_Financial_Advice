We are the leading global marketplace for unforgettable travel experiences

Around the world, we have thousands of locally vetted, expert-curated experiences to choose from. Together with top-rated local partners and 24/7 customer service, our platform is the easiest, most intuitive resource to find a destination’s best activities and attractions.GetYourGuide 2023 Recap by our founders Johannes and Tao.

The problems we are solving

The way we travel has changed. It's no longer about how we get there or where we sleep, but about the experiences we have. 

Finding those incredible things to do isn't always easy though, with 80% of the experiences market offline and largely fragmented. At GetYourGuide, we're changing that.

With more people exploring the world, rapid digitalization, and the increasing desire for unforgettable experiences, we’re in a unique position. And while the experiences market itself is huge, our opportunity extends beyond travel. We’re already building for what’s next and are leading the pack. Come join us on this exciting next step in our journey.Open roles
Unlocking the unforgettable since 2009

A lot of the work we are doing today is defining the global experiences category. But there's so much more to unlock on this journey. There’s more to create, more to discover, and even more to build. 

We've used the challenges of the pandemic to strengthen our relationships and culture and while the last decade kickstarted our growth, we believe that this one will define it.
