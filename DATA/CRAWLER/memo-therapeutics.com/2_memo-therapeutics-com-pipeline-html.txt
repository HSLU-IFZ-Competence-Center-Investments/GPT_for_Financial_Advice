Pipeline

Memo Therapeutics AG’s (“MTx”) lead program, , is a highly effective and safe neutralizing antibody to treat BK virus infection in kidney transplant recipients. MTx’ pipeline consists of additional therapeutic antibodies focusing on infectious diseases, such as cytomegalovirus (“CMV”), undisclosed immuno-oncology targets as well as a partnership with Ono Pharmaceutical.

Our infectious diseases arm reflects this approach by selecting rare patients as donors for antibody discovery who were able to successfully clear a viral infection.

Our first anti-infectious program addresses an unmet medical need in immune-compromised patients that suffer from infection by a normally harmless virus. Our development candidate is a broadly neutralizing antibody sourced from clinically selected donors showing a high potency for virus neutralization and inhibition of re-infection.

AntiBKV

MTx’ lead program, AntiBKV, is a highly effective and safe neutralizing antibody to treat BK virus infection in kidney transplant recipients. This infection can lead to loss of kidney function, as well as organ failure and rejection. AntiBKV has successfully completed Phase I with no safety concerns, with Phase II (POC) data expected in H1 2025.
