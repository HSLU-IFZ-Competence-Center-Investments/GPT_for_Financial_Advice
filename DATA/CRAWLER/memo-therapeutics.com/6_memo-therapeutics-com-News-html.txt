Discovery of SARS-CoV2-neutralizing antibodies from COVID-19 patients

Schlieren, March 18, 2020. Memo Therapeutics AG is deploying its microfluidic technology platform DROPZYLLA®, to create cognate recombinant libraries from COVID-19 patients who overcame infection in a particularly efficient manner (“elite controllers”). In comparison to other technlogies having a capture rate of far below 5%, MTxs libraries comprise at least 80% of a patient’s antibody repertoire. Capturing essentially the whole antibody repertoire is of crucial importance since antibodies with neutralizing activity represent only a minority of the antibodies made by the human immune system.
