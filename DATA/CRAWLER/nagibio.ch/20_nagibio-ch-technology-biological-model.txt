Powerful models for powerful datapoints

Nature’s gift to science

Meet the powerful model organism

Caenorhabditis elegans has been known for more than 60 years as an important exploratory biological model in fundamental research. It helps in addressing various biological questions in the fields of aging, neurobiology, genomics, and developmental and cellular biology. 

A world of possibilities opening up

To this date, large amounts of mutant, transgenic and “humanized” worm strains are available. More specifically, C. elegans is distinguished by its ease of genetic manipulations: single genes can be simply inactivated by feeding the worms with bacteria expressing dsRNA against the gene of interest (RNA interference method). Nowadays, any specific strain can be generated easily “on-demand” using modern CRISPR-Cas9 techniques.

strong relevance & proven translatability to human biology

C. elegans is a well-studied model with useful features for rapid investigations.

C. elegans blog posts

Many pathways important in development, reproduction and modes of toxic action are conserved.

Concordant response areas include growth, development, LD50 ranking and neurotoxicity.

Failure in later stages of the R&D pipeline is especially costly. We actively pursue technologies to identify adverse toxicology as early as possible, such as Nagi Bioscience’s technologies.

Unfavorable toxicological profiles are a major cause of late failure in our discovery pipelines. Failure in later stages of the R&D pipeline is especially costly. We are actively pursuing technologies to identify adverse toxicology as early as possible, including through the use of model systems such as those being investigated by Nagi Bioscience.

Methodologies to assess lifespan and healthspan measures in a high-throughput manner are currently inadequate in the C. elegans field. The integration of Nagi’s technology opened many possibilities for us as a company.

Before proceeding to clinical trials, the efficacy of our existing drugs or combinations thereof for their positive impact on healthspan will be tested in the nematode C.elegans. However, methodologies to assess lifespan and healthspan measures in a high-throughput manner are currently inadequate in the C. elegans field. The integration of Nagi’s technology into Rejuvenate opened many possibilities for us as a company.
