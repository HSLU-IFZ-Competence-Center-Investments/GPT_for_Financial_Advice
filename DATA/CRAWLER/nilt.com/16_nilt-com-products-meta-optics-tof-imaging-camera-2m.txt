TOF | Imaging camera

Metalens-based Time of Flight (iTOF) system with a dual meta-surface Rx lens.

NILT’s innovative indirect time of flight (iTOF) system showcases depth mapping capabilities using a two-surface (2M) Rx metalens, effectively substituting three to four traditional refractive lenses. This iTOF metalens integrates several NILT patents-pending technologies designed to minimize stray light and multi-path interference, resulting in highly accurate depth maps.
