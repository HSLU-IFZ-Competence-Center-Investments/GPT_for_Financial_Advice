Dot Projection

Single-surface 2-in-1 dot-projector for driver-monitoring and depth-sensing

Our demonstration systems highlight the remarkable capabilities of our record-breaking single-surface metalens dot projectors, unveiled in October 2023. These innovative projectors consist of a single surface adept at collimating light and projecting precise dot patterns. The use of a single surface not only streamlines the module design but also facilitates the creation of exceptionally compact dot-projector modules. We are showcasing three distinct configurations with fields of illumination (FOI) of 70° x 40°, 70° x 70°, and a record-setting 144° x 70°, all demonstrated live.

These projectors boast over 70% efficiency, less than 10% dot uniformity error, and high contrast ratios exceeding 40:1. 

Dot projection optics are made with metaoptic according to customer specifications. The metaoptic are single surface (1M); typically used for 3D sensing (structured light and time of flight) for face recognition, short distance Lidar, etc.

NILT can design, prototype and manufacture metaoptic to state-of-the-art standards.Dot projection designed for stand alone, or to be used with external collimatorDesign freedom to match desired FoI with perfect N x M tilingSingle-surface element allow for extreme miniaturization of optical systemExtreme FOI possibleDot projectors can be designed both for collimated as well as divergent light sources with a high number of possible use casesAll dot projectors can be optimized to customer requirements

1. Dot projector 70 x 40 degree

The dot projector has a 3 x 3 tiling, FOI of 70⁰ x 40⁰, efficiency above 70%, and dot uniformity-error <10%, making it an ideal platform for most 3D sensing applications where low power consumption is critical.

2. Dot projector 70 x 70 degree

The dot projector has a 3 x 5 tiling, FOI of 70⁰ x 70⁰ and demonstrates an efficiency above 70% even with its relatively larger FOI.

3. Dot projector 144 x 70 degree

The dot projector has a 5 x 5 tiling, FoI of 144⁰ x 70⁰, yet maintains a dot-uniformity-error around 20% which is highly advantageous for applications such as in-cabin monitoring.(The full projected pattern is pincushion distorted but the corners are clipped by the limited field of view of the detector)

4. Dot projection by collimator 

This dot projector is based on collimation without fan-out. This means that the number of projected dots equals the number of emitter in the VCSEL array and the FOI is givel bu the focal length of the metalens collimator.
