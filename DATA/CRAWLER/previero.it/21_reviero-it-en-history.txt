The company has been belonging to the PREVIERO family for three generations.

At the beginning of the 1920’s, Mr. Natale PREVIERO began to work as an agent in Como for metal and wood processing machinery.

The earliest documents located in the Alzate Brianza town archives describes the start of business in 1922.

During the same time, Natale created a mechanical workshop and offices for servicing wood and textile machinery, the dominating industries in Como at that time.

In the 1950’s, Natale’s son Oscar decided to invest in the development of machinery for the emerging yet young plastic market and moved the head offices to Lipomo.

In these days many types of machinery were produced, including the first blade granulators. In the 1970’s, production was concentrated on grinding and cutting machinery.

At the end of the 1970’s, Oscar’s trhee sons (Flavio 1951, Aldo 1954 and Dario 1958) took direction of the company, building the successes of their father and grand father. Among their many projects:

Building of offices and factories in Alzate Brianza and Anzano del Parco
Installing 3D CAD systems
Installing CAM machinery
Market research for the optimisation of the products

In 1992 PREVIERO purchased the outstanding shares of its sister company, SOREMA from Domenico Gazzoni.

SOREMA business of plastics recycling plants is currently operated out of the Anzano del Parco factory.

La società PREVIERO appartiene alla famiglia PREVIERO da 3 generazioni. All’inizio degli anni ’20, Natale Previero inizia la propria attività con la rappresentanza di macchine per l’industria tessile e del legno nel territorio di Como.
