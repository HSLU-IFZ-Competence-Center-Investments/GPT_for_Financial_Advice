How do I order a laptop or Chromebook from The Rent Company?

You have decided to order a new laptop at The Rent Company. Great!

Ordering a laptop at The Rent Company is very simple. Your school or educational institution has given you a code. You can enter this code on our order page.

Once logged in, you can choose the laptop and running time that suit you best. You can also order extras, such as an extra charger.

Not at a school affiliated with The Rent Company? At Laptop Campus you can also order a laptop as a private individual. This way you can still enjoy the benefits of Easy4u! 

What is the difference between buying and renting?

Whether you rent or buy, a laptop from The Rent Company always comes with the Easy4u all-in-1 subscription. There is no difference in terms of service.

There are, however, a number of other differences:

- Whenrenting, you have the laptop on loan. When you buy it, it is immediately your property

- With renting, you pay a deposit. This deposit is four times the monthly fee. When you return the laptop at the end of the term, you get your deposit back. No deposit is charged when buying a laptop

- In case of renting, you pay a fixed amount per month or per year. When buying, you always pay the full price in one go 

Where can I find the code to order a laptop?

Your school or educational institution will give you a code with which you can order. This code can also be found on the flyer you received from your school.

Didn't receive the code or lost it? We can help with that! Click on the ' with Chip' button at the bottom right of the screen and type in 'schoolcode'.

Chip will be happy to help you! 

Until when can I order a laptop for the new school year?

To be sure we can deliver on time, we ask you to order before 31 July. After this date we can often still have the laptop ready in time for the start of the new school year, but this is something we cannot guarantee. Also the prices as they are in the web shop cannot be guaranteed after 31 July. So order in time!

It is possible to order a laptop at The Rent Company all year long, even when the school year is in full swing. We then estimate a delivery time of 5 to 10 working days.

Are there any costs related to the repair?

With the Easy4u all-in-1 subscription, you are assured of a quick and good repair. In many cases this is free, for example, when there is a factory error or when the laptop no longer works properly due to normal use.

If the laptop is broken due to damage, for example, falling off a table or water damage, we charge a limited deductible amount of 50 euros.

In some cases, when we see that the laptop is broken on purpose, we will charge the full repair costs. Fortunately, this does not happen often. Please see our Terms and Conditions for more information. 

How long does a repair take?

One thing is for sure: when your laptop is broken, you want it back as soon as possible! We try to complete every repair within 10 working days. However, this is not always possible.

We hope for your understanding.When your laptop is ready to be collected, we will of course notify you immediately.Acer laptopsFor Acer laptops, the repair period is currently 20 working days. This is because the parts needed to repair are very hard to get. We understand this is annoying, but hope for your understanding!

My laptop has been stolen

When your laptop is stolen, it's obviously incredibly frustrating! In some specific cases, the theft of your laptop is covered by the warranty.

Which laptops can I choose?

When you log in with the code you received from your school or educational institution you will go directly to your personal webshop. Here you will see the offer that was made together with the school. When you order a laptop or Chromebook from The Rent Company, you can be sure that you always have the right device to get started! 

What is the offer based on?

For each student, the school works with The Rent Company to determine which laptops or Chromebooks to choose. This offer is completely tailored to your school trajectory. We then look at several things, such as:

- Does the laptop or Chromebook have enough memory?- Is the laptop or Chromebook fast enough?- Does the laptop or Chromebook have other features such as a touchscreen?

On this basis, we make a choice to offer one or more laptops or Chromebooks in the webshop of your school or educational institution. You always make the right choice! 

Why an education laptop from The Rent Company?

At The Rent Company, we offer security. Because we select the right laptop or Chromebook together with the school or educational institution beforehand, you always make the right choice. We also deliver all our laptops and Chromebooks in combination with the Easy4u package. Click here to read more about Easy4u!

The laptops and Chromebooks are standard equipped with a rubberized housing, extra sturdy hinges and hardened glass. This way you can be sure that the laptop or Chromebook will withstand the everyday life as a student laptop. Watch the video below to see more about education laptops!

What software is on the laptop?

Windows laptops are fully installed and ready to use. This includes any software applications that have been coordinated with the school or educational institution. This includes at least the following software:

Windows 10 operating system

7-ZipAdobe ReaderAdobe FlashAdobe ShockwaveGimp photo editing softwareGimp video editing softwareJava Tools and RuntimeMicrosoft .Net FrameworkMicrosoft Edge, Google Chrome and FirefoxMicrosoft Office 365 pre-installMicrosoft Windows DefenderPaint.NetQuick TimeSilverlightSkypeVLC media player

Please note! We do not provide licenses for the use of Microsoft Office. This is arranged by the school. Therefore, if you privately order a laptop or drop out of school, you must provide it yourself.

Because a Chromebook works through the internet, the apps and programs used are offered to school through the Cloud. This configuration is done through the Google Classroom software that the school manages. 

What is a Chromebook?

A Chromebook is a computer that comes with Google's Chrome OS operating system. The Chromebook takes only a few seconds to boot up and has built-in protection against viruses.

Unlike a normal computer, with a Chromebook everything is stored and processed in the Cloud, a kind of online server. With a Chromebook, therefore, no local storage is needed. 

Will I get a BKR registration with a rental contract?

No. We believe it is important that all children can participate in digital education. That is why we have ensured that there is no need for verification or registration with the BKR. 

Where can I find my invoices?

To view your invoices, log in to your Easy4u account. Once logged in, click on 'Invoices'. Click here to log in directly. 

How do I change my bank account number?

At the moment it is not yet possible to change your IBAN in your Easy4u portal. Should you want to change this data, we ask you to send an email to administratie@rentcompany.nl. Please include:

- Name of the student- Debitor number- Name of the account holder- Old IBAN- New IBAN

Should the IBAN change to someone else's IBAN, please email that person yourself or include them in the CC of the email. 

Can I purchase the laptop and pay for it in installments

When you purchase a laptop, it always has to be paid at once.Â

Lenovo 300w touchpad/keyboard does not work

It may be possible that your laptop (Lenovo 300w) thinks it's in tablet mode. Normally this only happens when the laptop is folded in half, but because of a bug in the software, this can also happen due to other influences. For example, by a metal object coming close to the laptop or when 2 laptops are lying on top of each other.The latest BIOS update solves this problem in most cases. You can install this by following the steps below:

Go to this page and enter the serial number.
Go to ''Drivers & Software.''
Click on ''Select Drivers''.
Click on ''BIOS/UEFI''.
Click ''Download'' next to BIOS Update and install the software.

Are you still encountering problems after the BIOS update? Then report your laptop for repair. 

My battery is draining very fast, how come?

As the battery ages, the battery life decreases. Here are a few tips to keep the battery in good condition for as long as possible and not to consume unnecessary power:

-Charge the battery until it is completely full. Only then should you remove the laptop from the charger. Leaving the laptop on the charger all the time, even when it is already full, is also bad for the battery life.-Set the brightness and contrast of the screen to a lower level.-Don't run a multitude of programs at once, but rather close them after use.-Playing games (only during breaks!) consumes a lot of battery power.

If your battery is working so badly that it prevents you from using your laptop optimally, you can submit your laptop for repair. We will then judge what the issue is and, if needed, replace the laptop. There may be costs involved.
