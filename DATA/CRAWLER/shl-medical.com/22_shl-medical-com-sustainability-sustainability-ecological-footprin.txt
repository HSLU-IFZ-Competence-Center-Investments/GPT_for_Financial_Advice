Our commitment is to achieve a substantial reduction in greenhouse gas emissions across our value chain. This will be accompanied by the integration of circular design principles into new products, as well as the minimization of waste generated by our operations. Our initiatives are geared towards making a measurable impact on our environmental footprint. We are achieving this through environmental life cycle assessments (LCA) of our products. Moreover, we are actively curbing plastic consumption by promoting reusability and adopting innovative, eco-friendly plastic materials such as bio-based plastics and recycled variants. 

We actively pursue a profound reduction in emissions with a clear target set for the year 2030. Simultaneously, a decisive shift towards utilizing 100% renewable energy sources by the same year is underway. These intertwined objectives underline a steadfast dedication to combating climate change and embracing a sustainable energy future.

By 2025, it is our target to ensure that 100% of new products strictly adhere to sustainable design principles. Moreover, we set the goal to achieve a 30% reduction in environmental impact from each device by the year 2030. These dual objectives reflect a significant commitment to sustainable practices, aiming to harmonize product innovation with environmental responsibility. 

	To conserve natural resources and the reduce waste, we aim to minimize generated waste and concurrently increase the proportion of recycled production waste. This strategy underscores a commitment to responsible resource management and sustainable practices, contributing to both environmental preservation and efficient resource utilization.
