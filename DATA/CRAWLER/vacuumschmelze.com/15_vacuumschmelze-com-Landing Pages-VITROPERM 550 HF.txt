 Efficient Noise Suppression– 

Nanocrystalline Cores offer Volume, Weight and cost optimized HF-designs

VITROPERM® 550 HFisthe latest addition to the family of nanocrystalline alloys that are characterized by outstanding properties. The newly developed alloy enables next-generation components with optimized size andweight, especially for HF-noise reduction.Cores made from this alloyenable high RFI-noise suppression, particularly, in the HF-range in innovative filter designs with higher performance forfuture applications. 

Significantly reduced volume/weight due to improved HF-properties
Superior HF-attenuation compared to standard VP 500 F
Low core losses due to lower eddy currents
Excellent thermal stability over a wide temperature range

 A Superior EMC Solution

VITROPERM alloys are optimized to combine highest permeability and lowest coercive field strength. The combination of very thin tapes and the relatively high electrical resistance (1.1 - 1.2 µΩm) ensures minimal eddy current losses and an outstanding frequency vs. permeability behaviour. Combined with a saturation flux density of 1.2 T and a wide operational temperature range, these features make VITROPERM a universal solution for most common EMC problems and vastly superior in many aspects to commonly used ferrites and amorphous iron materials.

By utilising low-cost raw materials (Fe-based) and modern, large-scale production, VITROPERM is a very competitive solution for a wide range of applications.

The table shows a comparison of typical material data of alloys used e.g. for common mode chokes.

 Root element of PhotoSwipe. Must have class pswp. 

 Background of PhotoSwipe.
 It's a separate element as animating opacity is faster than rgba(). 

 Slides wrapper with overflow:hidden. 

 Container that holds slides.
 PhotoSwipe keeps only 3 of them in the DOM to save memory.
 Don't modify these 3 pswp__item elements, data is added later on. 

 Default (PhotoSwipeUI_Default) interface on top of sliding area. Can be changed. 

 Controls are self-explanatory. Order can be changed.
