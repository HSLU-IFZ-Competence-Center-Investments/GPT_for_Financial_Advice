 Permanent Magnets and Assemblies

The positioning of magnets with extreme precision, especially small one, and the very high forces associated with large-volume magnetized parts, make the assembling of magnet systems a challenging task. For this process we can apply our extensive experience in the design and construction of assembly tools and our expert knowledge in the selection of a suitable bonding process.

VACOMAX® is our permanent magnet material made from rare-earths and cobalt. These magnets have particularly high coercivities with simultaneous high saturation polarization and excellent temperature and corrosion stability.

VACODYM® magnets are produced on the basis of neodymium-iron-boron alloys and have the highest energy density available today. VACODYM alloys are anisotropic material grades.

 Root element of PhotoSwipe. Must have class pswp. 

 Background of PhotoSwipe.
 It's a separate element as animating opacity is faster than rgba(). 

 Slides wrapper with overflow:hidden. 

 Container that holds slides.
 PhotoSwipe keeps only 3 of them in the DOM to save memory.
 Don't modify these 3 pswp__item elements, data is added later on. 

 Default (PhotoSwipeUI_Default) interface on top of sliding area. Can be changed. 

 Controls are self-explanatory. Order can be changed. 

 Preloader demo http://codepen.io/dimsemenov/pen/yyBWoR 
 element will get class pswp__preloader--active when preloader is running
