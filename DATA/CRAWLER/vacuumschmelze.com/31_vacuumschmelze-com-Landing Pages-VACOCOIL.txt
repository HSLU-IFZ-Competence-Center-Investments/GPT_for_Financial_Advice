 – VACOCOIL
 Improved Attenuation at High Frequency

Common Mode Chokes (CMCs) with the patented VACOCOIL design offer improved attenuation at high frequency (f > 1 MHz) compared to standard designs.

10x improved impedance compared to standard design (@10 MHz)
Optimized for high current applications

 Root element of PhotoSwipe. Must have class pswp. 

 Background of PhotoSwipe.
 It's a separate element as animating opacity is faster than rgba(). 

 Slides wrapper with overflow:hidden. 

 Container that holds slides.
 PhotoSwipe keeps only 3 of them in the DOM to save memory.
 Don't modify these 3 pswp__item elements, data is added later on. 

 Default (PhotoSwipeUI_Default) interface on top of sliding area. Can be changed. 

 Controls are self-explanatory. Order can be changed. 

 Preloader demo http://codepen.io/dimsemenov/pen/yyBWoR 
 element will get class pswp__preloader--active when preloader is running
