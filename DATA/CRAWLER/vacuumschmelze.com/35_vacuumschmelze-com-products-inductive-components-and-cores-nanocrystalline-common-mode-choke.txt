Superior EMC Filter and Common Mode Choke Design

Nanocrystalline cores are widely used in common mode choke (CMC) applications due to their unique combination of magnetic properties. By utilizing low-cost raw materials (Fe-based) and modern, large-scale production, VITROPERM is a very competitive solution for a wide range of applications.

Our CMCs feature high attenuation which is maintained across a wide frequency range offering extremely broadband attenuation. In many cases, this characteristic can allow a reduction of the number of filter stages in multistage EMC filter configurations to reduce complexity, cost and filter volume. Copper losses are also reduced, thus increasing the efficiency and lowering component temperature.

We have extensive practical and theoretical expertise in the design of CMCs and filter configuration using nanocrystalline cores and components. At higher frequencies, the winding configuration has a major effect on the parameters of winding capacitance and leakage inductance and is therefore carefully considered in our choke designs.

Design Advantages with VITROPERM

The superior material properties of nanocrystalline VITROPERM enable common mode chokes with high inductance/impedance, even with a small number of turns, resulting in reduced copper losses, low winding capacitance and excellent HF performance. Due to the high initial permeability, low winding capacitance and a low Q-factor, VITROPERM CMCs offer a broadband insertion loss curve ranging from 10 kHz up to several MHz and improved attenuation behavior at both low and high frequencies. Better attenuation properties and an extended operating temperature range allow a reduction of the component volume by a factor of up to 3 or more under similar conditions. The excellent attenuation of VITROPERM CMCs simplifies the filter design in a wide frequency range.
