Where does the VR content come from? How to create it?

Varjo provides some example demos (or so-called showcase applications / VR content) in virtual and mixed reality. These can be accessed from the Varjo Account Portal after you have purchased one of our devices and created your own Varjo Account. These VR/XR demos showcase the capabilities of our devices, including high resolution, eye tracking, hand tracking, as well as mixed reality features for the Varjo XR-3. The example demos can be downloaded on your computer and accessed straight away after setting up your device to experience the groundbreaking capabilities of Varjo’s technology.

You can also download immersive applications from the Steam VR store. All Varjo devices support SteamVR and OpenVR content. Additionally, Varjo supports various professional-grade applications and custom engines in training and simulation, engineering, design, and research – explore a full list of Varjo-ready software here for further details.

If you would like to create your own virtual or mixed reality content with a game engine such as Unity or Unreal Engine, we have step-by-step instructions available on our developer site.
