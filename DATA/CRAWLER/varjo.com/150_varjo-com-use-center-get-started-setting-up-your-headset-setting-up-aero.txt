Setting up Varjo Aero

You will need a Varjo Account to use Aero. Two account types are available:

Commercial accounts are for commercial purposes.
Personal accounts are intended for personal use.

Choose the account type that best fits your needs.

Follow these steps to set up your headset:

1. Log into Varjo Account Portal

To get started, log into Varjo Account Portal.

If you don’t have an account yet, you can create one now. Choose either a commercial or personal account to fit your needs.

2. Download Varjo Base from Varjo Account Portal

Varjo Base is the software used to run your headset. It contains everything you need to use the headset on a Windows computer.

Note that Varjo Base 3.4 or later is required to use Aero. If you have an older version of Varjo Base, please download and install the latest version.

When you install Varjo Base for the first time, you may be prompted to also install Microsoft Visual C++ 2019 X64 Minimum Runtime.

3. Start Varjo Base

Varjo Base will help you set up your headset. You can also follow along the setup steps on this page.

When you start Varjo Base for the first time, we will run a system check to confirm that your computer is compatible with the headset. See System requirements for more information.

4. Log into Varjo Base with your Varjo Account

In Varjo Base, log in with your Varjo Account to start setup.

If your company has enabled Microsoft single sign-on with Varjo, you can also login using Microsoft SSO.

Note that your computer needs to be connected to internet during setup.

5. Select your headset model

When you start Varjo Base for the first time, it will automatically open the first-time user guide to help you through the setup process. You can open the guide at any time in the Support tab under Run setup.

Select your headset model to view detailed instructions on how to connect your headset.

6. Connect your headset

When connecting the headset, a headset adapter or laptop adapter is required to supply power to the headset. Do not connect the headset directly to your computer.

Choose one of the following cabling options to connect your headset:

Headset cable: Connect to the headset adapter.

Headset adapter: Connect to a DisplayPort port on the graphics card and to a USB-A 3.0 / 3.1 port on the motherboard.

Power supply unit: Connect to the headset adapter and to a power source using one of the included power plugs.

B. Laptop adapter (sold separately)

This cabling option is for laptop computers and does not require the headset adapter supplied with your headset. For recommended laptop models and configurations, see Varjo-Ready computers for Varjo Aero.

Headset cable: Connect to the laptop adapter.

Laptop adapter: Connect to a USB-C port on the laptop. Note that the USB port on the laptop must be routed directly to the dedicated NVIDIA GPU and include support for Alternate Mode.

Power supply unit: Use the power supply unit included with your headset. Connect to the headset adapter and to a power source using one of the included power plugs.

C. Headset adapter with third-party Mini DisplayPort–DisplayPort adapter

This cabling option is for laptops with a Mini DisplayPort port routed directly to the GPU. For recommended laptop models and configurations, see Varjo-Ready computers for Varjo Aero.

Headset cable: Connect to the headset adapter.

Headset adapter: Connect to a Mini DisplayPort port with a Mini DisplayPort–DisplayPort adapter and to a USB-A 3.0 / 3.1 port on the laptop.

Note that the Mini DisplayPort–DisplayPort adapter must support 8K video and DisplayPort 1.4 with Display Stream Compression (DSC). See the list of tested and compatible adapters.

Power supply unit: Connect to the headset adapter and to a power source using one of the included power plugs.

When you connect the headset to your computer for the first time, Windows will recognize the headset as a new USB device and install the appropriate drivers.

7. Update your headset firmware if prompted

Varjo Base will automatically check that your headset firmware is up to date. If the firmware is not compatible with the current version of Varjo Base, you will be prompted to update the firmware.

8. Enable OpenXR and OpenVR runtimes if prompted

Varjo Base will attempt to automatically enable the OpenXR and OpenVR runtimes for Varjo headsets. If you have previously used an OpenXR- or OpenVR-compatible headset on this computer, you may be prompted to enable the runtime manually.

Enable the runtime if you want to run OpenXR and OpenVR applications, such as SteamVR apps. 

We recommend that you also enable Software updates and Crash reporting.

9.  Optional: Connect your headphones

For applications that include sounds or voice input, you can plug in your headphones on the left side of the headset. Headphones with a standard 3.5mm audio jack are compatible with Varjo headsets.

In-ear headphones are included with Aero.

If necessary, see instructions on how to select the correct audio output and input source on your Windows computer.

Continue setup by selecting a tracking method for your headset. The Varjo Aero headset supports the following tracking systems:

 SteamVR™ Tracking uses up to four SteamVR™ base stations to track your headset and optional controllers.
 Third-party tracking methods can also be integrated with Varjo headsets.
