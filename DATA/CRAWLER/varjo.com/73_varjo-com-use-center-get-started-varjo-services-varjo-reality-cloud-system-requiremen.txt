Note about laptop graphics cards

Laptop graphics cards with identical names can perform differently depending on factors such as the thermal design of the laptop and amount of memory on the card.

Some key terms to keep in mind when comparing graphics cards:

Total Graphics Power (TGP): The maximum power consumption of a graphics card, which gives an indication of its maximum performance.
GPU memory: Graphics cards come in many variants with different amounts of memory on the card, which also affects performance.

See below for hardware requirements for laptop computers running Varjo Reality Cloud. s are higher for mixed reality than for virtual reality applications.
