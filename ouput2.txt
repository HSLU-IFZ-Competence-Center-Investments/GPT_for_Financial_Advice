# Age is missing! Could be portfolio 1 or 2

Customer: Hi. I am not sure about how to invest. Could you help me?
Advisor: Of course, I'd be happy to help. Before we get started, can you tell me a little bit about your financial goals? 
Are you looking to save for retirement, a down payment on a house, or something else?

Customer: I am mainly looking to save for retirement, but I also want to make sure my money is safe and secure.

Advisor: Great, retirement planning is an important goal. Can you tell me a bit about your current financial situation? 
What is your income and expenses like?

Customer: My income is around 120K a year, and my expenses are pretty stable. 
I have a mortgage, some car payments, and a few other bills, but I generally have some extra money left over each month.

Advisor: That's helpful to know. Now, before we discuss any specific investment options, 
I'd like to ask you a few questions about your risk appetite. How comfortable are you with taking risks when it comes to investing?

Customer: I have a low risk appetite. I prefer safe and stable investments over high-risk ones.

Advisor: Understood. It's important to find investments that align with your risk tolerance. 
I'll keep that in mind as we discuss potential options. Is there anything else you'd like to know or any questions you have before we move forward?

Customer: Yes, I wanted to ask about the current financial situation in the world and specifically in Switzerland. Can you give me an overview?

Advisor: Certainly. The global economy has been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, and Switzerland is no exception. 
However, Switzerland has a strong and stable economy, and the government has implemented measures to support businesses and individuals during this time.
 The Swiss National Bank has also taken steps to stabilize the financial markets. Overall, while there have been some challenges, 
 Switzerland remains a relatively safe and stable place to invest.

Customer: Thank you for the information. What investment options would you recommend given my situation and risk appetite?

Advisor: Before I make any specific recommendations, I would like to gather more information about your investment goals and time horizon. 
How long do you plan to invest your money for? Are you looking for short-term or long-term investments?

Customer: I am looking to invest for the long-term, around 15-20 years.

Advisor: Then, I would recommend portfolio 1.
